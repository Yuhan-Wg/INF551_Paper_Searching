Fee et al. found that the height of the ash plume during the Pavlof eruption could be inferred from sound waves detected by distant infrasound arrays and measurements of seismic tremor. The use of sound waves for monitoring is uncommon but well suited for remote eruptions, especially when we lack visual or satellite observations. Science, this issue p. 45 Effective weather prediction, climate modeling, and marine ecosystem studies benefit from a robust understanding of sea surface temperatures. Unfortunately, because surface temperature measurements are conducted in many ways, the results are often discrepant, reducing the reliability of downstream models that use them. Recently, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) noted and rectified a systematic error in some data sets. The corrections imply that sea surface temperatures have increased more rapidly than was thought. Hausfather et al. compared the corrected estimates to largely independent data sets not subject to the systematic errors. Their results confirm the NOAA corrections and affirm that rates of sea surface warming are indeed higher than previously reported. Sci. Adv. 10.1126/sciadv.1601207(2017). Antiplatelet drugs are commonly used to prevent stroke in high-risk patients. Unfortunately, a frequent side effect of these drugs is excessive bleeding. To improve the safety margin of antiplatelet agents, Wong et al. identified a new target for treatment, a platelet receptor called PAR4. They developed a small-molecule drug and evaluated its efficacy and safety in animal models. The new drug was no less effective and had a much larger therapeutic window than the widely used antiplatelet agent clopidogrel. Sci. Transl. Med. 9, eaaf5294 (2017). Face recognition abilities improve as humans age. Our ability to recognize faces improves from infancy to adulthood. This improvement depends on specific face-selective regions in the visual system. Gomez et al. tested face memory and place recognition in children and adults while scanning relevant brain regions. Anatomical changes co-occurred with functional changes in the brain. Some regions in the high-level visual cortex showed profound developmental maturation, whereas others were stable. Thus, improvements in face recognition involve an interplay between structural and functional changes in the brain. Science, this issue p. 68 Many elemental metals, such as lead and aluminum, become superconducting at low temperatures. Bismuth, a semimetal with very low carrier density, stays nonsuperconducting down to 10 mK. Prakash et al. performed tricky magnetization measurements to show that pure bulk bismuth does undergo the superconducting transition at a tiny temperature of about 0.5 mK (see the Perspective by Behnia). Because bismuth does not fit neatly into the standard picture of superconductivity, further theoretical work is necessary to explain the findings. Science, this issue p. 52; see also p. 26 The Solanaceae (or nightshades) are one of the best-studied plant families, yet their evolutionary origins have thus far been relatively obscure. Corroborative fossil evidence of molecular phylogenetic divergence dates has been lacking. Wilf et al. present 52-million-year-old fossils of lantern fruits from Argentina, which they ascribe to the modern genus Physalis. These fossil finds suggest a much earlier origin of the lantern fruit lineage and indicate that the Solanaceae may have diversified before the final breakup of the Gondwanan supercontinent. Science, this issue p. 71 Meiosis is a specialized double cell division that generates haploid gametes from diploid parent cells. Meiotic recombination between homologous chromosomes ensures the proper segregation of chromosomes to the daughter cells. Mimitou et al. carried out a genome-wide survey of resection of the ends of DNA double strand breaks in yeast. Resection generates single-stranded tails that are vital for meiotic recombination. The Tel1 kinase promoted initiation of resection. Nucleosomes, which normally package DNA, needed to be disassembled to allow rapid and efficient resection. Science, this issue p. 40 Polymer molecules at a free surface or trapped in thin layers or tubes will show different properties from those of the bulk. Confinement can prevent crystallization and oddly can sometimes give the chains more scope for motion. Xu et al. found that a conducting polymer confined inside an elastomer—a highly stretchable, rubber-like polymer—retained its conductive properties even when subjected to large deformations (see the Perspective by Napolitano). Science, this issue p. 59; see also p. 24 An essential step in the life cycle of lentiviruses such as HIV-1 is when viral DNA integrates into the host genome, establishing a permanent infection of the host cell. The viral integrase enzyme catalyzes this process and is a major drug target. During viral integration, integrase binds the ends of viral DNA, forming a higher-order structure called the intasome. Passos et al. and Ballandras-Colas et al. used cryo—electron microscopy to solve the structures of the intasomes from HIV-1 and maedi-visna virus (ovine lentivirus), respectively. These structures reveal how integrase self-associates to form a functional intasome and help resolve previous conflicting models of intasome assembly. Science, this issue p. 89, p. 93 Producing mass quantities of chemicals has its roots in the industrial revolution. But industrial synthesis leads to sizeable sustainability and socioeconomic challenges. The rapid advances in biotechnology suggest that biological manufacturing may soon be a feasible alternative, but can it produce chemicals at scale? Clomburg et al. review the progress made in industrial biomanufacturing, including the tradeoffs between highly tunable biocatalysts and units of scale. The biological conversion of single-carbon compounds such as methane, for example, has served as a testbed for more sustainable, decentralized production of desirable compounds. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aag0804 The human genome generates many thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). A very small number of lncRNAs have been shown to be functional. Liu et al. carried out a large-scale CRISPR-based screen to assess the function of ∼17,000 lncRNAs in seven different human cell lines. A considerable number (∼500) of the tested lncRNAs influenced cell growth, suggesting biological function. In almost all cases, though, the function was highly cell type—specific, often limited to just one cell type. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aah7111 The continuing development of density functional theory (DFT) has greatly expanded the size and complexity of molecules amenable to computationally tractable simulation. The conventional metric of success for new functionals has been the accuracy of their calculated energies. Medvedev et al. examined how well these functionals calculate electron density across a series of neutral and cationic atoms (see the Perspective by Hammes-Schiffer). Although historically the accuracies of energy and density have improved in tandem, certain recent functionals have sacrificed fidelity to the true density. Science, this issue p. 49; see also p. 28 The dwarf planet Ceres in the inner solar system is thought to have a crust made of a mixture of rock and ice. Prettyman et al. used neutron and gamma-ray spectroscopy from the Dawn spacecraft to peer below Ceres' surface and map the subsurface composition. They found evidence for water ice across the dwarf planet, with water making up a larger fraction of the material near the poles than around the equator. Together with their measurements of other elements, these results aid our understanding of Ceres' composition and constrain models of its formation. Science, this issue p. 55 Nectar-feeding pollinators, when given a choice, tend to prefer nectar with high concentrations of sugar. Nectar-producing plants, however, tend to produce more dilute nectar. This mismatch between selective force and trait value has long been seen as an evolutionary paradox. Nachev et al. used a dynamic flower array that evolved in real time in a Costa Rican rainforest to show that the “paradox” is, in fact, driven by pollinator choices (see the Perspective by Farris). Bat pollinators based their choices on small, nonlinear differences in nectar sweetness, which led to selection for less sweet nectar overall. Science, this issue p. 75; see also p. 25 The date of the first permanent human occupation of the high Tibetan Plateau has been estimated at about 3600 years ago, when agriculture became established. Meyer et al. used several dating techniques to analyze sediments at a high-altitude site (4270 m) where human handprints and footprints have been found. Their analysis indicates occupation of the plateau 7400 years ago and possibly earlier. These dates are consistent with the genetic history of Tibetans and suggest that a permanent preagricultural peopling of the plateau was enabled by the wetter regional climate at that time. Science, this issue p. 64 Prostate cancer growth is fueled by male hormones called androgens. Drugs targeting the androgen receptor (AR) are initially efficacious, but most tumors eventually become resistant (see the Perspective by Kelly and Balk). Mu et al. found that prostate cancer cells escaped the effects of androgen deprivation therapy through a change in lineage identity. Functional loss of the tumor suppressors TP53 and RB1 promoted a shift from AR-dependent luminal epithelial cells to AR-independent basal-like cells. In related work, Ku et al. found that prostate cancer metastasis, lineage switching, and drug resistance were driven by the combined loss of the same tumor suppressors and were accompanied by increased expression of the epigenetic regulator Ezh2. Ezh2 inhibitors reversed the lineage switch and restored sensitivity to androgen deprivation therapy in experimental models. Science, this issue p. 84, p. 78; see also p. 29 Circulating antibodies from bone marrow—resident plasma cells help to protect the thymus from infection. Nuñez et al. found that plasma cells that reside in the human thymus produce antibodies that are reactive to common viral proteins. These cells inhabit the thymic perivascular space between the thymic epithelial areas and circulation and may fortify the thymus against pathogen invasion. The plasma cells are maintained in aging individuals, presumably contributing to lifelong thymic protection. Sci. Immunol. 1, eaah4447 (2016). Lipid accumulation in the liver, a condition called hepatic steatosis, often develops in metabolic syndromes such as obesity. The de novo synthesis of lipids contributes to lipid accumulation and is inhibited by Lipin1. Shimizu et al. found that Lipin1 that was phosphorylated at specific sites was degraded by a ubiquitin ligase complex containing β-TRCP1. Hepatocytes lacking β-TRCP1 had more Lipin1 and reduced triglyceride content. Moreover, mice deficient in β-TRCP1 were protected against diet-induced fatty liver, suggesting that treatments that target this pathway could prevent hepatic steatosis. Sci.

Indeed, with the 2016 launches of Science Immunology and Science Robotics, the Science family now has six members including, in addition, Science, Science Signaling, Science Translational Medicine, and Science Advances. This growth has occurred through a number of distinct opportunities, involving the emergence of new multidisciplinary research areas as well as alternative ways to accelerate the communication of research. The family now embodies a range of publishing and editorial models, with the content of Science Robotics and the open-access journal Science Advances handled by academic editors. But the Science journals share a common focus on high quality and, in general, relatively broad scopes. This focus will be maintained as we consider adding to the family. We encourage enthusiasts and the curious to peruse our newest journal, Science Robotics, which is now freely available with a trial subscription through May 2017 to individuals and institutions with Science site licenses.* How can we describe the contents of the Science family of journals and relate this profile to that of other journals? Of course, this can be most directly done by examining editorial statements and reading papers from the different journals. An alternative approach involves using natural language processing methods to analyze the contents as described in the accompanying post in Sciencehound (http://blogs.sciencemag.org/sciencehound/2017/01/05/science-family-journal-content-analysis). Briefly, my approach involves taking abstracts from a large body of published papers, measuring the “distance” between each pair of papers based on the fraction of words that the abstracts have in common, weighting words that are rare in the overall body of papers, and then depicting these relative distances in a two-dimensional projection. Assessing abstracts in this manner from 3 years of Science, as well as most papers from the other Science family journals published in 2016, results in a three-pointed figure. Examination of the papers that lie in each of the three arms reveals that one arm corresponds primarily to biomedical sciences, one to physics and physical sciences, and one to Earth sciences and evolution. That this relatively simple analysis generates an intuitive structure relating the different disciplines is perhaps not surprising. However, it is reassuring that an unbiased analysis of the language that describes scientific projects captures this essential feature of the scientific enterprise. What is the value of such an examination for the Science family of journals? More detailed analysis reveals that these journals cover different portions within each arm, albeit with some overlap. Papers from Science and Science Advances cover the landscape broadly with substantial representation in all three arms and in the central core. Those from Science Signaling, Science Translational Medicine, and Science Immunology lie primarily in the biomedical arm. As expected, papers from the inaugural issue of Science Robotics lie near the center extending toward the physical sciences arm. This raises interesting questions about the characteristics of papers that lie close to one another in the three-arm landscape and the relative outliers. Following trends over time using this kind of analysis could reveal aspects of the evolution of different disciplines and subdisciplines, and may even influence the launching of new journals or other modes of scientific communication. Applying analytical tools such as this natural language processing approach to journal content has considerable potential for assessing the structure of the scientific enterprise and the relationships of different disciplines. Gleaning knowledge from such data sets is an important goal; the challenge is to find the best questions and tools. As the new year begins, I anticipate that many exciting manuscripts will be published in the Science family of journals. For active researchers, we hope that you will continue to consider our journals for your most exciting results. For all readers of our journals, I welcome feedback on all fronts. *Also, free individual trial access to Science Immunology through 14 February 2017.

Anaerobic microbial processes in oxygen minimum zones cause a disproportionately large fraction of the loss of fixed nitrogen in the open ocean. Interestingly, though, there has been no indication of such nitrogen loss in the oxygen minimum zone of the Bay of Bengal. Bristow et al. quantify the abundance of microbial genes associated with N2 production to help resolve this enigma, finding that the Bay of Bengal supports denitrifier and anammox microbial populations that mediate low but significant N loss while at the same time allowing the trace levels of oxygen to support nitrite oxidation. If this oxygen were removed, nitrogen loss in the Bay of Bengal oxygen minimum zone could accelerate greatly. Nat. Geosci. 10.1038/NGEO2847 (2016). Many male beetles exhibit enlarged ornaments and weapons, which are believed to function in sexual selection. However, the size and degree to which these structures can develop in an individual is variable and dependent on nutrition. Ozawa et al. found that the nutritional effect on the size of the mouthparts of the broadhorned flour beetle is mediated by epigenetic modifying factors, such as histone deactylases and Polycomb group proteins. Silencing of one histone deacetylase (HDAC1) in the beetle larvae shrank the mandibles of the ensuing adults, whereas silencing of another (HDAC3) led to exaggerated mouthparts without much affecting other body parts. The results indicate that ornamentation in these beetles is under modular epigenetic control. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 10.1073/pnas.1615688114 (2016). Unnatural amino acids can be incorporated into target proteins by using a transfer RNA (tRNA)—aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair that adds an unnatural amino acid at an amber stop codon. The strategy has been used in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and for generating transgenic invertebrates. Chen et al. have succeeded in integrating a construct coding for the unnatural amino acid p-azido-phenylalanine (AzF) into the mouse genome. The artificial gene was transmitted to subsequent generations and caused no obvious physiological defects. Primary cells from adult transgenic mice incorporated AzF into a fluorescent reporter protein containing an amber codon. Similarly, the genetic code of zebrafish was expanded, and in vivo incorporation of AzF into reporter protein was achieved. This opens the potential to investigate the function of target proteins in living animals. Cell Res. 10.1038/cr.2016.145 (2016). B cell failure can cause preterm labor in mice. Around one-third of cases of premature labor are caused by infection and inflammatory responses. B cells are specialized immune cells that should protect from pathogens, but their role in pregnancy is poorly defined. Huang et al. have identified a functionally distinct population of B cells in the choriodecidua (a specialized uterine lining that separates the mother from the fetus) that is associated with preterm labor in women. Mice lacking B cells had diminished levels of progesterone-induced blocking factor 1 (PIBF1) and were also more prone to premature labor after inflammation. But when B cell function was compensated by administering PIBF1, inflammation in the uterus and preterm labor were reduced in the B cell—deficient mice. The cytokine interleukin-33, which normally raises the alarm for inflammation, is responsible for stimulating B cell production of PIBF1. These insights provide therapeutic possibilities for maintaining term pregnancy. Nat. Med. 10.1038/nm.4244 (2016). The protein Crumbs2 is essential for gastrulation. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the process by which cells move out of a structured, epithelial tissue and become motile. EMT is implicated in cancer metastasis and is critical during embryonic development. At gastrulation, newly specified mesodermal cells undergo EMT and move inside the embryo, giving it a trilaminar structure. Ramkumar et al. show that in mice, the apical protein Crumbs2 is critical for cells to leave the epithelial epiblast and move inside the embryo to form a new tissue layer. In the absence of this protein, mesoderm formation is disrupted, and cells do not ingress. Instead, a single layer forms, and the embryo fails to properly establish its body plan, leading to embryonic arrest. Nat. Cell Biol. 18, 1281 (2016). Short bunches of electrons are used extensively to yield information about the structure of materials and the dynamics of phase transitions. Traditionally associated, perhaps, with “big science,” the availability of accelerator beam time and the timing resolution of the pulses can be limiting factors for experimental studies. Huang et al. have developed a matchbox-sized all-optical electron gun in which a single terahertz pulse is injected into a copper waveguide. Synchronized with a photogenerated pulse of electrons, the terahertz pulse accelerates the electron bunch over high fields and with low energy spread so that they can be used for low-energy electron diffraction studies. Further developments could lead to the generation of ultrashort relativistic electron bunches and the prospect of miniaturized accelerators. Optica 3, 1209 (2016). Many of the limitations of lithium ion batteries arise from the liquid electrolytes because they limit the operating voltage; they are often flammable and can contribute to the decreased capacity of a cell. Solid-state electrolytes could solve these problems, but there have been challenges at the interfaces to reduce the impedance, and when lithium is used as the anode, it can react with most solid-state electrolyte materials. Han et al. show they can solve the interfacial stability and wetting problems between lithium and the garnet-like electrolyte Li7La2.75Ca0.25Zr1.75Nb0.25O12 by depositing a thin layer of aluminum oxide by means of atomic layer deposition.

But even knowing this in advance, I found that writing was a challenge as I made my way down the tenure track. I had trouble finding stories in my data sets. Even when I had a good tale, I struggled to tell it. I tried starting with the opening sentences and hoping I'd make it to the paper's end. But more often than not, I wrote my way down many blind alleys. My permanently unfinished papers outnumbered my published ones. Worst of all, I was not helping my Ph.D. students and postdocs learn proper writing craft. “I … ask the Ph.D. student or postdoc to play the role of would-be movie director.” My big break came shortly after getting tenure. In a passing conversation, a senior colleague mentioned that his process for writing research papers centered on structure. Rather than focus on words and sentences, the part of writing that so bogged me down, he highlighted the importance of outlining the overall story to be told. I had thought that the standard paper structure—introduction, methods, results, discussion, conclusions—was enough to keep me on track. But my colleague helped me realize that, even with those sections, there is still enough freedom to get stuck in writing cul-de-sacs. I now see each of the standard paper sections as its own Russian nesting doll. Writing papers is easiest when you spend considerable thought and time stacking all these pieces first. I call it the top-down writing approach. Each of my group's papers now starts with a storyboard session at a whiteboard. I pretend to be a big-time Hollywood producer and ask the Ph.D. student or postdoc to play the role of would-be movie director pitching a new movie to me. Their pitch must answer three questions: What is the status quo? What is wrong with the status quo? How does this new paper go beyond the status quo? This approach helps frame the story and place key figures and technical findings in context. Balancing each of the status quo elements is a great way to set up the introduction—often the toughest section for early-career scientists to write—and to lead the reader to the research questions or hypotheses. Say too little about what we already know and one risks losing a large audience who may be unfamiliar with the topic. Too little about what's wrong with the current state of knowledge and the reader may wonder why we need yet another paper on that topic. Too little about how the work goes beyond what others have done and the novelty is unclear. The result is a roadmap of the novel elements in the work, which brings the discussion—the other tough section for the writing newcomer—into final focus. Once the pitch makes sense, we go back and forth stacking the Russian dolls on the whiteboard until the outline subheadings become paragraph topics, with every paragraph explicitly represented in the outline. Honing this outline prior to any writing allows us to determine whether the research story resonates from start to finish. We might spend days or weeks on the outline to get it right, but it's time well spent. The slavish adherence to nested headings shows at a glance whether the paper makes a clear and worthy contribution; whether the title, objectives, and results are properly aligned; what figures are truly essential to the storyline; and whether the message hums. Writing then becomes a much easier process of filling in the blanks. The paper is effectively finished before the sentence writing starts. I haven't mastered the writing game, and I am still constantly learning. But the top-down approach has been a game changer in my group. Now, when a new grad student indicates an interest in an academic career, I ask, “So you want to be a Hollywood producer?” ", "pdfLink": "http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6320/102.full.pdf"}, {"category": "Letters", "type": "Letter", "title": "Prejudgment call", "author": [], "authorInstitution": [], "publisher": "American Association for the Advancement of Science", "date": "2017/01/06", "doi": "10.1126/science.355.6320.22", "textLink": "/content/355/6320/22.full.txt", "pptLink": "/content/355/6320/22.full.txt", "imageLink": null, "text": "In his 30 September 2016 Working Life “Doing science while black” (p. 1586), E.

To follow up on his story, in October, we asked young scientists these questions: Have you ever been prejudged based on your appearance or background? What advice would you give to a scientist who had the same experience that you did? What can institutions, professional societies, or individuals do to prevent such experiences in the scientific community? We heard from researchers facing a variety of assumptions and stereotypes, some of whom requested that we withhold their names. Here, we present some of their experiences and advice. WHEN I SOUGHT a faculty position at top universities in China, they often replied that faculty positions were reserved for those who have a foreign Ph.D. degree or many years of research experience. Such staff recruitment policies postulate that all domestic Ph.D.s are inferior to foreign ones. My advice: Institutions or professional societies should establish comprehensive evaluation systems that rely on ability and achievement rather than foreign diplomas and university ranking. This would open the door for domestic scientists to show their potential. Han Lin School of Engineering Management, Nanjing Audit University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 211815, China. Email: linhan@gmail.com “OVERSEAS RETURNEES” (those with degrees from foreign institutions) are expected to be more productive in research than those trained in China, but we are also required to spend as much time as local faculty members teaching courses, applying for grants, advising students, and providing administrative services. My advice: Leaders in Chinese institutions of higher education should dispense with the double standard and adopt a fair evaluation system for all faculty members. Liangyan Wang Department of Marketing, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, 200030, China. Email: WLY@sjtu.edu.cn WHEN I SHARE my interest in pursuing a career in the biomedical field, many assume that I want to be a nurse, whereas most people assume my male colleagues want to be physicians. My advice: Institutions and professional societies should hire more women in executive positions and invite more women to be keynote speakers to reflect the number of women in the biomedical workforce. Yuka Takemon The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME 04609, USA. Email: yuka.takemon@gmail.com WHEN I WAS in college, I was often asked, “What do you study?” When I replied “geology,” I would receive incredulous stares, followed by, “Ah, theology! That is good for a girl!” My advice: Stand your ground and explain exactly what you do. Do not let people diminish you or your work. Liane G. Benning Helmholtz Centre Potsdam, GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Telegrafenberg, 14473, Potsdam, Germany. Email: benning@gfz-potsdam.de WHEN I WAS 6 months pregnant and directing an archaeological project, I was often confronted by male landowners and village chiefs asking directions to the PI. “You are speaking to her,” I would say. The responses were guffaws, disbelief, and an insistence that I didn't understand the question. Frustrated, each abruptly turned away and approached my male crewmembers, who pointed back to me. At least one said, “But she's a woman.” My advice: Rely on patience and humor, and focus on the passion that drove you to your discipline in the first place. Altering a cultural habit or tradition is like shifting the tides—it takes perseverance. Over time, your expertise and integrity in your research will be recognized, trusted, and respected by the local community. Felicia Rounds Beardsley Department of Sociology and Anthropology, University of La Verne, La Verne, CA 91750, USA. Email: fbeardsley@laverne.edu I WAS THE invited speaker at a meeting. When I arrived, the organizer told me that I could set up the coffee and snacks on the back table. My advice: Organizations and professional societies need to be mindful of including scientists of all races, genders, and ages. The more people see diversity, the more “normal” it becomes! Wendy Bohon Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS), Washington, DC 20005, USA. Email: bohon@iris.edu I AM A MUSLIM who wears a niqab that covers my face. My niqab doesn't prevent me from doing or teaching science. Still, even in a Muslim country like Egypt, I was forbidden from teaching an international program because of my religious clothing. My advice: Institutions and professional societies should make clear that researchers have the right to follow their religious traditions, as long as those traditions do not prevent the researchers from doing their jobs. Basant A. Ali Department of Chemistry, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt. Email: basant_walieldeen@alex-sci.edu.eg A FEW DAYS after September 11th, 2001, I was walking around the campus of the University of Michigan and a woman yelled out, “I know you bombed us!” Until that moment, I had not realized my brown skin and goatee might cause someone to think of me as a terrorist threat. I was devastated. My advice: We all need to work to make academic settings safe for people of all sexes and races. Prosanta Chakrabarty Museum of Natural Science, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA 70803, USA. Email: prosanta@lsu.edu MY SUPERVISOR MADE no effort to hide her resentment of my abaya and headscarf. I ignored her insulting comments and kept it on. I was the only student in a headscarf attending her classes. I was proud to see that my refusal to back down paved the way for others. My advice: Try your best not to succumb to pressure. Be aware of your rights and what to do if they are violated. Universities should provide a safe and nondiscriminatory environment. Name Withheld Pakistan AS AN INTERNATIONAL student from India, people assumed that my spoken language would be atrocious and that I would be able to handle everything technical/IT related. My advice: Develop patience and a dry sense of humor. Naga Rama Kothapalli Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019, USA. Email: ramakn@ou.edu AS A YOUNG international student with limited English, I could see people slowly disconnect from me while I was talking, avoid me, or act as if I could not do anything on my own. I was not sure how to react. I needed a little extra help but I did not want preferential treatment. My advice: Students and professors should talk to international students directly. Universities should educate the campus community about how to interact with international students and where to direct them for help. Felicia Olmeta-Schult School of the Environment, Washington State University, Vancouver, WA 98686, USA. Email: folmeta@wsu.edu I WAS ONCE told by a member of my lab that PCR stands for Puertorricans Can't make the Reaction. Everybody laughed, even me, but now I can see how inappropriate that comment was. My advice: Every semester, departments should invite speakers from all backgrounds, especially first-generation scientists. In addition to science, speakers should address gender equity, unconscious bias, and cultural sensitivity. Lilliam Casillas-Martinez University of Puerto Rico-Humacao, Humacao, PR 792, USA. Email: lilliam.casillas@upr.edu DROP OUT OF a graduate program and it will haunt your career like a felony conviction. Despite the prejudice I've faced for lacking a graduate degree, I have built a career over many years that matches the success of many of my colleagues who completed graduate programs. We express concern over the lack of public engagement in science, yet feel free to excoriate fellow scientists who lack advanced degrees. We need to embrace our own diversity. My advice: Always be the best-prepared person in the room. Robert L. Martone Memphis, TN 38103, USA. Email: rlmartone@mail.com I HAVE FOUND that people tend to prejudge research quality based on the authors' affiliations. My advice: For those judging, focus more on the research itself rather than the rank of the researchers' institutions. For those being judged, high-quality research products are the most powerful rebuttal to affiliation prejudgment.
