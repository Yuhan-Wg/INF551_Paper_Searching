The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the publisher of Science, certainly cannot be accused of that, having grown to only four journal titles in 136 years. Yet many members of the scientific community have encouraged AAAS to expand its repertoire, arguing that the Science family of journals is high quality, well curated and edited, and worth supporting because they enable the mission of a nonprofit scientific society that is governed by scientists working to further the best interests of the scientific community. It is thus with some pride that I describe the launch in 2016 of two new journals: Science Robotics and Science Immunology. \u201cEditors can launch journals, but it takes excellent authors to make them successful.\u201d Science Robotics will welcome cutting-edge advances from researchers working in human health, space, ocean, land, atmosphere, industrial, and service environments. These advances could arise from breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, systems design, materials science, new sensors, power systems, propulsion systems, advanced actuators, enhanced reliability and durability, or even in the science of human-robotic interfaces and interactions. I am pleased to announce that Professor Guang-Zhong Yang from Imperial College London has agreed to serve as Editor for this new journal. Immunology is in a period of unprecedented evolution and expansion, and Science Immunology will showcase new trends in this exciting field. Previously underappreciated, the influence of the immune system is vast, touching aspects of health and disease that are just beginning to be understood. The immune system is mobile and pervasive, and integrates with all bodily systems and organs. New tools are revealing the extent of this influence with exceptional precision and reach. Science Immunology will welcome articles that explore these exciting developments, in any organism\u2014particularly humans. The Science family of journals also seeks to become \u201cauthor-centric\u201d publications, moving toward a process that gives authors maximum flexibility in deciding which journal is most suitable for their paper. A robotics paper could be submitted to Science Robotics if the target audience is the robotics community or to Science or Science Advances if it is important that the paper reach an audience broader than the robotics community. To target the medical research community, a medical robotics manuscript might be best presented in Science Translational Medicine. While Science will remain our highest-impact journal, Science Advances, an open access title launched in February 2015, may be the best venue for results that are of immediate interest to broad audiences in and beyond the academic community. An immunology paper will have a number of suitable options within the Science family\u2014Science, Science Immunology, Science Advances, Science Signaling, or Science Translational Medicine\u2014depending on the topic and the intended audience. We will make it easy to submit a paper to multiple Science journals by allowing authors to indicate their priority order of journals at the time of initial submission, with reviews being transferred between Science journals if the authors so desire. What value do two more journals bring to the already crowded scientific publishing landscape? Although the number of publications is growing, what isn't increasing is the researcher's time. By expanding the Science journal family, authors will have more opportunities to publish under the Science umbrella, where their papers benefit from careful peer review and editing, broad dissemination, and high visibility. Carefully curated content published in Science journals helps busy researchers find which papers to prioritize from the flood of information available. Editors can launch journals, but it takes excellent authors to make them successful. If your research might fit with Science Robotics or Science Immunology, please watch for the first calls for papers, coming soon!

It is a major step toward preventing some of the worst risks that climate change presents to the global economy and security. Now is the time to seize the opportunity that this moment represents. We must transform world economies away from fossil fuels toward a more sustainable low-carbon future. \u201cNow is the time to\u2026transform world economies\u2026toward a more sustainable low-carbon future.\u201d Research and innovation have a critical role in this transformation. Advances in renewable energy generation, smart energy storage, smart grids, and improved energy efficiency will help countries meet the targets they have signed up to in Paris for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But crucially, these advances will enable countries to increase their emission reduction targets, which are set to be reviewed every 5 years under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change system. Indeed, nations must increase their targets if we are to achieve a safe and stable climate in which temperature rise is limited to less than 2\u00b0C. The Paris agreement sets out a distinct long-term goal of net zero emissions in the second half of the century, showing that the world is committed to decarbonizing the economy. This sends a strong signal to industry and investors that the shift is global, irreversible, and transformational, and provides confidence that will clear a path for the private sector to drive a long-term solution. Many companies are considering signing up to 100% renewable energy pledges. The dynamic has changed\u2014previously, the cost-benefit analysis was more finely balanced; now, it is a higher-risk strategy not to invest in renewable energy and sustainability. There is already more investment in renewable energy globally than there is in conventional energy. This trend is expected to increase to meet the enormous new demand resulting from the Paris agreement. Although there is currently a shortage of good investable green projects, an increase in finance to meet the new demands for clean energy will create more business opportunities for such projects, such as cheap and large rechargeable batteries and solar- and battery-powered airships for transport. \u201cMission Innovation,\u201d the initiative announced in Paris, will see 20 countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States, double their public sector budgets for clean energy research and development. In addition, the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, a global group of private investors including Bill Gates, will provide investment flows of potentially $20 billion in its early stages, for the most promising new clean energy technologies that can be streamlined into the marketplace. Backed by the U.S. and UK governments, the Energy Africa initiative aims to ensure that every home in Africa has clean, affordable energy by 2030. A huge challenge, indeed, but renewable clean energy is already growing faster in many developing nations than it is in richer countries because it makes economic sense and is the right choice for environmental and health reasons, too. So the direction is set: decarbonization. The target: to reduce greenhouse gas emissions fast enough to prevent the worst impacts of climate change from hitting all of us, particularly the world's poorest and most vulnerable. The opportunity: immense. The question that remains: What part are you going to play?

But the vast majority of U.S. school districts have remained hierarchical operations that ignore the wisdom available from their best classroom teachers. After decades of failed top-down solutions, now is the time to create a massive national movement that empowers and deeply respects our teachers. Scientists and science teachers can lead the way. \u201c\u2026now is the time to create a..national movement that empowers\u2026our teachers.\u201d Producing an effective system of education is an extremely complex endeavor. Yet despite this complexity, U.S. policy-makers have been employing one simplistic top-down solution after another in attempts to improve schools. The most recent fiasco has been the high-stakes test-based accountability introduced by the federal government's No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Against the advice of experts, the nation has even been mistreating teachers by grading them according to the annual test gains of their students, ignoring dominant out-of-school influences as well as research showing that teacher differences account for only about 10% of the variance in student test score gains in a single year.* Perhaps not surprisingly, the job satisfaction reported by U.S. teachers has fallen from 62 to 39% in 5 years, and the number of young Americans planning teaching careers has plummeted. How can the United States learn from this failure and make a new start, now that the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 has repealed many of the 2001 act's most harmful features? It is way past time to create a major national movement that aims to have outstanding experienced teachers provide effective, regular input that powerfully steers their school district's (and their state's) policies and practices, while remaining in their classrooms with at least a part-time schedule. Today's students need to learn how to work collaboratively and to communicate effectively using evidence and logic, while sorting, analyzing, and critiquing information. A skilled, experienced teacher creates appropriate challenges for each student, constantly suggesting ideas and connections to follow. A wise friend, with decades of leadership experience in my local public school system, is convinced that \u201cexperienced, effective teachers are a vastly underutilized resource in education systems\u2026perhaps the only resource that can truly create the change and improvements that students and teachers deserve.\u201d But such teachers are rarely used appropriately, and they can even be resented by school system bureaucracies. Launching an effective national movement to empower teachers will require casting a wide net to select specific strategies. Such an effort should begin by seeking advice from the best teachers. This can be done immediately for science, where an appropriate set of networks already exists. The organizations that oversee these networks would then form a consortium to select, and strongly advocate for, a small set of specific policies. Collaborations will need to be developed with national institutions that represent other critical aspects of the U.S. education system\u2014in particular, superintendents, principals, teachers' unions, school boards, education schools, parent organizations, and community groups. Such a national movement could, for example, develop a merit-based system for selecting lead teachers, define specific roles for them in schools and school districts, and find ways for them to be paid to stay in the classroom with part-time administrative/professional development roles (rather than being enticed with raises to permanently leave school sites). The situation is urgent: Unless the United States can make dramatic advances in empowering its teachers, the nation will never have public school systems that make the best decisions for their students. Nor will it be able to attract and retain the highly talented teacher corps that every nation needs.\u2020 \u21b5* E. H.

Both actions reflect the world's recognition that development in all nations hinges on a stable and resilient Earth system. This is a political paradigm shift, fortified by three decades of remarkable advancements in Earth system science. The International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), which ended in December 2015, can take considerable credit for coordinating and catalyzing much of this fundamental research. The recently launched Future Earth research program builds on this legacy and is the right response to the new scientific challenges. \u201cFuture Earth\u2026is the right response to the new scientific challenges.\u201d Formed in 1986, IGBP became the first major international program to conceptualize Earth as a whole system. Its objective was \u201cto describe and understand the interactive physical, chemical and biological processes that regulate the total Earth system\u2026and the manner in which they are influenced by human activities.\u201d Its visionary research agenda attracted leading scientists from advanced and developing countries, and brought together thousands of researchers through interlinked research initiatives such as the Global Carbon Project (GCP) and the Past Global Changes (PAGES) project, all of which continue to generate key scientific insights. In December 2015, GCP published its 10th annual carbon budget during the Paris climate summit, indicating a decline of 0.6% in the growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions in 2015, potentially the first decrease during a time of world economic growth. Earlier last year, PAGES researchers concluded that sea levels could stabilize at around 6 meters higher than preindustrial levels if global temperature were to increase 1\u00b0 to 2\u00b0C. The integrated systems perspective is what made IGBP so important, particularly its focus on the dynamics and feedbacks between the climate system and the biosphere. From its freewheeling intellectual spirit, unbounded by political mandates, emerged profound scientific insights, such as the concept of the \u201cGreat Acceleration\u201d in human activity since the 1950s, and quantification of this impact on Earth. IGBP will forever be associated with the concept of the Anthropocene\u2014the scientific conclusion that Earth has entered a new geological epoch dominated by human interference\u2014which was first discussed at an IGBP meeting in 2000, was published in the IGBP newsletter that same year, and was central to IGBP's first synthesis report, Global Change and the Earth System: A Planet Under Pressure. IGBP was a foundation for the now-established field of Earth system science and influenced the research trajectory of many institutes. This new knowledge, and the sheer scale of responsibility that the Anthropocene represents, necessitate an evolution to global sustainability science. Future Earth is the next logical step and brings together natural and social sciences to work toward more integrative global change science and solutions-oriented research that engages governments, civil society, research funders, and the private sector. The new initiative has the support of an influential coalition of international bodies, including the International Council for Science, the United Nations, and the major national research funders. Future Earth international offices have now been established in Canada, France, Japan, Sweden, and the United States, and national and regional networks and offices are growing rapidly. But Future Earth's success will lie in its ability to stay true to IGBP's legacy. As IGBP projects transfer to Future Earth, the new program must continue to attract the best scientists and institutions. Earth system resilience and stabilization are necessarily rising to the top of political and scientific research agendas. With humanity at a critical juncture, Future Earth has the potential to become the largest, most ambitious international research program ever undertaken.

Worldwide, 161 million children under the age of 5, many of them in Africa and Asia, suffered irreversible stunting as of 2013. The developed world is not immune. As recently as 2010, stunting affected 8 to 9% of babies enrolled in U.S. federal food-subsidy programs. Next week in Washington, DC, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS is the publisher of Science) will convene its annual meeting (11 to 15 February), where world leaders will discuss food security and other major challenges that lie ahead in both the science and international policy arenas. \u201c\u2026diversity in opinions, ideas, and experiences fuels creativity and innovation.\u201d Ensuring a sustainable world in the face of climate change and a world population of 9 billion demands a major shift in how nations seek ingenious ways to coexist with ever-expanding needs for energy, food, water, and a healthy environment\u2014situations that are complex and interconnected. Solutions demand innovative international research partnerships and policies that include talents and perspectives from both the developed and developing worlds. This collaboration will be the focus of the AAAS meeting, under the theme \u201cGlobal Science Engagement.\u201d The meeting will provide an opportunity to hear about the latest new approaches and creative thinking from around the world. Amid budget constraints and current isolationist views, many policy-makers, including those in the United States, may understandably see international initiatives as less important than domestic ones. Such research isolation is unwise. Water security is a good example. The United States spends billions of dollars making water potable and then flushes an estimated 90% of that water down the toilet or drain. There is much to learn from countries such as Namibia, the most arid country in southern Africa, where people have been drinking recycled water since 1969 with no health consequences, or Singapore, which has no natural aquifers and a small landmass. International research collaborations can save money in the long run. To solve complex global problems, the world's technical workforce must include countries at all economic levels. No segment can be ignored or overlooked in the talent search, because diversity in opinions, ideas, and experiences fuels creativity and innovation. We can no longer afford to lose talented young women around the globe who were science stars in their early schooling and career preparation, yet later were lost from the technical talent pool\u2014lost to factors that are not beyond control but require a strong global commitment to resolve. In my work with developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, I continue to be impressed by the talent and creativity of scientists there: male and female, abled and disabled, young and old. We need their ideas and perspectives as much as those from countries with advanced science and technology infrastructures. But their ability to connect with scientists in the more developed research mainstream is fraught with difficulties, including international cultural biases that also make it difficult for them to get access to, or publish in, respected journals. Equally, I see scientists and engineers, especially the younger generation in the United States, who are passionate about global research engagement but do not know how to connect with potential partners in the developing world. I applaud organizations that have a history of success in facilitating such connections. AAAS has a long history of international engagement activities, as have other scientific societies, but we all can do more to facilitate international research networking, collaborations, and journal access. Through the upcoming AAAS Annual Meeting and beyond, I hope that countries can commit to strengthening these connections. It is imperative for the sustainability of the planet and those malnourished babies in Laos and around the world, whose lives we cannot afford to waste or lose.

Why AAAS?\u201d My thoughts about the nature and service of science and the mission and goals of AAAS\u2014the world's largest general science membership organization\u2014have since been focusing on new and revitalized efforts that will continue to make AAAS the principal voice for science.

The organization has been doing these things for more than a century and a half, and today's more than 100,000 members make it possible for AAAS to continue to show the public the beauty and cultural enrichment found in science, the power of evidence-based thinking, and the practicality of policies that integrate good science. And yet, I am often struck by how few people know about the work of AAAS. Some readers of this editorial are AAAS members and may know about the important work of the organization, but probably most readers are not members, accessing Science through institutional subscriptions at their worksites. Even those who are members often think of themselves as subscribers only and forget that they belong to an organization that is a powerful force for science, engineering, and technology in the world. Indeed, the influence of AAAS has been potent: from helping to create the U.S. National Science Foundation soon after World War II, to forging the foundation for modern education reform; from convening the Science and Human Rights Coalition, to successfully advocating for a U.S. national forest service and the scientific management of resources; from funding the legal defense in the 1925 Scopes trial on teaching evolution, to challenging today's politically motivated interference in research in climate change and in social and behavioral sciences, and denouncing legislated restrictions on the study of gun violence as a public health issue. Moving forward, AAAS will continue its outspoken presence on issues of the day. We will also work with other science and engineering societies to raise the standards of the practice and application of science around the world, as well as annually place nearly 300 Ph.D.\u2013level scientists in fellowships in various departments of the U.S. federal government. We will, with the Kavli Foundation, recognize excellence in science journalism with the most prestigious annual awards. And through various activities, including publication of the journal Science and Diplomacy, AAAS will focus the world's attention on the role that science plays in international relations. These and other accomplishments of AAAS, too numerous to describe here, can be attributed to one important factor: its members. The numbers, strength, and wisdom of its members (many practicing scientists or engineers, many not) provide a tremendous driving force. Because AAAS values members so much, the organization is undertaking new initiatives to build, and better engage with, our network of members and fellows, so that together we can champion the mission of AAAS. I encourage scientists and all those interested in science to join AAAS and become part of an organization that will continue to advance science for human welfare.

Unlike some disasters, this one was not inevitable, and there were many warning signs that could have halted it much sooner. In the developed world, citizens have come to trust that basic public services such as water, power, and sanitation will be provided, for a fee, safely and reliably. Therefore, Flint is not just a nightmare for its 100,000 residents, because it causes all citizens to question whether public officials, who are entrusted with providing essential services, have health and welfare in mind. With criminal investigation of the Flint crisis now under way, my focus is not on assigning blame but on how to prevent a tragedy like this from happening again. \u201cHas trust in science been poisoned, along with the water?\u201d One strong recommendation is to involve scientists early on in major decisions that affect public health or safety. The city of Flint faced a $15 million budget shortfall, so it examined options for saving money by disconnecting from the Detroit municipal water system. The interim solution, while waiting for a pipeline to be built to a new water source, Lake Huron, was to use water from the Flint River. The plan should have factored in costs to limit the corrosion of lead from the aging pipe system. The water that Flint received from Detroit had been treated to prevent chloride from leaching lead from the pipes; Flint River water has eight times as much chloride, but was not treated as such. Just as important, public safety needs to be put into perspective with other costs. What is inexcusable in the Flint case is the apparent failure by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to weigh the costs of corrosion control against the harm to public health, despite informing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of their intent to control corrosion. For the 2 years that the Flint River water would be temporarily used, the total cost of corrosion control would have been about $1 per resident of Flint, so about $100,000. Surely residents have spent many times that on bottled water. By comparison, Governor Snyder of Michigan sought $28 million to fi x the problem that his office created. In cases of major issues affecting public health and safety, U.S. federal agencies should consider having policies that involve mandatory reporting to regional or national headquarters, if they do not already. Many federal agencies benefit greatly from local presence and good relations with their counterpart state agencies, but it can create too cozy a relationship that prevents confrontation. When EPA water-quality experts detected lead in the Flint River water up to 1000 times in excess of the federally accepted level, the agency apparently tried to work with the state privately to address the problem. But the state tried to undermine the EPA science, delaying any further action on the problem by many months. The Flint situation offered many opportunities for the research community. Within months of switching to the Flint River in the spring of 2014, local doctors reported signs of adverse reactions such as rashes and hair loss, all coincident with the tap water looking and smelling strange. By fall, General Motors publicly announced that it would stop using the water because it corroded engine parts at its Flint plant. A year later, the first academic reports of water-quality and human health impacts became public and were probably instrumental in prompting the switch back to Detroit municipal water. Researchers could rebuild public trust if scientists identify issues affecting public safety early, complete good-quality research quickly, and publicly release their findings. Flint is a disaster of many proportions, from the illnesses of its victims to the questions it raises about the integrity of government officials and science agencies. Has trust in science been poisoned, along with the water? I can no longer drink a glass of tap water without thinking about either.

Chances are good, given the continuing underrepresentation of women at senior levels of academia, that the senior scientist is male. If the student is also male, he likely has no doubt that the senior scientist wants to learn more about the research. If the student is female, she may wonder: Does he want to get acquainted with my work, or me? This is the scenario that Meg Urry of Yale University, current president of the American Astronomical Society, posed during a session on \u201cForward Focused Ethics\u2014What is the Role of Scientific Societies in Responding to Harassment and Other Workplace Climate Issues?\u201d at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in December 2015. \u201c\u2026it is always the student who pays the professional price\u2026\u201d Scientific societies have an intrinsic responsibility in this regard. They sponsor meetings, workshops, conferences, field trips, and other of site events that place scientists in close proximity for long hours in unfamiliar settings. Urry, who spoke out on the responsibility of scientific societies for taking action in the wake of the Geoff Marcy scandal, and other session speakers and panelists had excellent suggestions for promoting an environment free of harassment. Scientific societies need to widely disseminate policies that declare their intolerance for harassment of any sort. These must describe how violations of such policies can be reported, and to whom, and the process for investigating those violations. And societies should clearly prescribe what consequences could be levied against of enders: Immediate expulsion from the meeting? From future meetings? From the society? Ineligibility for honors such as fellowships and medals? Barred from publishing in society journals? Blocking of ending scientists' access to meetings, publications, and professional colleagues can be an effective means to limit professional advancement, especially when the relevant institutional employer is slow or somehow prevented from taking concrete actions. (For the policy of AAAS, the publisher of Science, see http://meetings.aaas.org/program/code-of-conduct/.) Urry puts the responsibility squarely on senior scientists for the consequences of any personal relationships that develop with students, because it is always the student who pays the professional price if and when such relationships disintegrate. She suggested that unless the senior scientist is willing to change institutions to avoid an uncomfortable situation for the student if the relationship dissolves, don't get involved in the first place. Many universities expressly forbid any relationships between professors and undergraduates. In the discussion after the presentations, several attendees, noting that the room was largely filled with women, asked what could be done to encourage more men to take leadership on addressing harassment issues. Blair Schneider, president of the Association of Women Geoscientists (AWG), offered that AWG looks for opportunities to bestow its awards on deserving men who are setting outstanding examples in educating and advancing the careers of women geoscientists. Perhaps the most disturbing comment came from a foreign student studying in the United States who described an incident of unwanted attention from a senior colleague. She availed herself of her institution's formal channels to raise a complaint, only to be told that she must have misinterpreted her senior colleague's behavior on account of her unfamiliarity with the country's language and culture. As her command of English was excellent, she asked if she should record future interactions to prove her claims. The response was that it would be illegal.

Remarkably, half a century ago, South Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world, recovering from the Korean War and facing serious economic difficulties. Today, it is a member of the G20 major global economies with a market value that ranks 11th in the world. Investment in science and technology as a development strategy is what made South Korea one of the world's fastest-growing economies. Now, as the nation promotes its new Creative Economy plan, KIST moves into its next 50 years, ensuring that science and technology remain the foundation of this new era of innovation. Armadillo-T, an experimental car made in South Korea \u201cWhat South Korea achieved in a half-century is considered nothing short of a miracle.\u201d KIST's establishment in 1966 is widely seen as the birth of Korea's modern science. Fifty years ago, then-president Park Chung-hee recognized the importance of science and technology in the development of a nation and created KIST, the first comprehensive research and development (R&D) institute in Korea. KIST shook up private industry as it developed technologies and transferred them to the industrial sector. Companies began to realize the importance of R&D, and thus began an era of tremendous investment in R&D. The Korean government established 16 R&D spinoff institutes from KIST, and over the past 50 years, government and industry support of science and technology fields has transformed the nation's agriculture-centered economy to a high-tech economy that encompasses the semiconductor, automobile, steel, shipbuilding, electronics, machinery, and petrochemical industries, among others. In 2014, this accounted for 4.29% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP), and South Korea ranked number one in the world in R&D intensity (R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP). The current administration under President Park Geun-hye has been quick to recognize that sustaining the nation's economic growth requires maintaining the competitiveness of Korean companies in an expanding global economy. A reengineering of the government's development strategy produced the Creative Economy initiative, launched in 2013. The new plan leverages South Korea's already strong science and technology capacity to spur innovative technologies and creative businesses as the next economic growth engine. To help facilitate this initiative, KIST is bolstering linkages among industry, academia, and government research institutes, and is providing technical and managerial assistance to startup companies and small and medium-sized enterprises. Although KIST's main focus is on basic and fundamental research, it is actively expanding its responsibilities to revitalize Korea's economy through programs that progress basic research outcomes to a market-ready level. Importantly, South Korea and KIST continue to help the global community. In 1996, the nation joined the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, becoming a strong voice with other governments for improving the economic and social wellbeing of people around the world. Given that KIST was born out of international development aid, particularly from the United States, the institute strives to serve as a model to help other countries and is currently assisting Vietnam in establishing a research institute, the Vietnam-Korea Institute of Science and Technology. What South Korea achieved in a half-century is considered nothing short of a miracle. Over the next 50 years, all nations will need to make great advances in meeting the challenges of a growing population, sustainable energy and food resources, health and disease issues, and climate change. KIST hopes not only to serve as a research pioneer and hub for national R&D, but to help South Korea make contributions that will bring a better quality of life to all people.

Even worse, these parasites might use such data to try to disprove the conclusions posited in the data's original source studies. The editorial raised the points of how anyone not involved in the original study could use the data without misrepresenting it, and the danger of perhaps arriving at erroneous conclusions. The editorial advised instead that data sharing be implemented by involving the authors of the original study as coauthors in follow-up research. The research community immediately took to Twitter under the hashtag #IAmAResearchParasite to voice opposition to the editorial. \u201cThere are costs\u2026for re-collecting data for new uses.\u201d Much of what we know about the large-scale features of this planet is apparent thanks to widespread data-sharing practices and the early establishment of data banks in the geosciences. Aspects such as determining the shape of the ocean floor, ocean chemistry, the internal structure of Earth's deep interior, the physics and chemistry of the atmosphere, and many other topics could not have been ascertained from a single investigator's field program. One meta-analysis I published on the South Pacific benefited from observations of my own and those of others, including the 18th-century British explorer Captain James Cook. Involving Cook as a coauthor on my paper was clearly not an option, any more than it would have been feasible or desirable to include the dozens of others, living or dead, who had contributed to the data repository. Many fields, including the biomedical sciences, are now benefiting from meta-analyses of data to better understand the big picture. Effective data sharing is not trivial or inexpensive to implement, and it takes more than community acceptance of the practice. Agencies supporting research in oceanography have long funded data and sample repositories and have encouraged data and sample deposition by making new awards contingent on compliance. Repositories are instrumental in setting formats for data, so much so that standard programs and apps accept and output data in the standard format. The marine community supports data professionals who are responsible for the quality control of data collected on ships and from other major observing programs. Often overlooked is the importance of community-established metadata, so that those not involved in the original research will know what the data mean. As an example, in an oceanographic temperature data base, the community had to agree on what T(0) meant. Was it temperature at atmospheric pressure? Temperature at the sea surface? Communities must discourage low-quality data collection. A well-attended poster presentation at one prominent scientific meeting some years ago compared the crossover errors (misfits) of non\u2013time-dependent measurements (such as depth soundings) from ships' tracks where they intersected in the world's oceans. Any discrepancy at a crossing could be attributed to poor data quality control on either ship, but with thousands of crossings, institutions with systematically more misfits than others stand out. The results did not escape the attention of the funding agencies that support ship time. There are costs to implementing data reuse, but there are also costs for irreproducible research and for recollecting data for new uses. And no amount of funding can reconstruct lost ephemeral or time-dependent phenomena for which the data were not well curated. No more excuses: Let's step up to data sharing. \u21b5* D. L. Longo, J.

Spacetime twisted, contorted, and rearranged itself in dramatic fashion, and ripples within its very fabric shot out across the cosmos. Occurrences like this happen hourly somewhere in the universe. What is notable is that on Earth, we detected these ripples, an event now known as GW150914. In the fraction of a second that we \u201cheard\u201d black holes shake up spacetime, a new window on the universe was opened where we hope to hear more black holes, cosmic phase transitions, and even the birth of the universe. The last big prediction of general relativity\u2014the existence of gravitational waves\u2014has been directly confirmed, and we now have a new way of advancing our understanding of gravity, the force that shapes our universe. Supercomputer simulation of spacetime during a black hole merger \u201cGW150914\u2026marked an extraordinary scientific milestone by a very curious species.\u201d Galileo Galilei urged, \u201cMeasure what is measurable, and make measurable what is not so.\u201d The team of scientists that built the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) did the latter, big time. On 14 September 2015, during its first engineering run, spacetime ripples from GW150914 wiggled the separation of mirrors 4 km apart in the LIGO detectors, situated in Hanford, WA, and Livingston, LA, by about 10\u221216 cm, one-thousandth the size of a proton. They made the too-small-to-measure measurable by using interferometry, a technique invented by physicist Albert A. Michelson, the first Nobel Prize winner from the United States. Galileo must be smiling. GW150914 not only awed scientists but also captured the attention and imagination of much of humanity, which is no small feat. This is big science well done. Researchers identified a lofty and worthy goal, and the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), in partnership with the California Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, funded and stuck with it until they succeeded, a timeline of almost 50 years. There were ups and downs. The brilliant invention of the first gravitational-wave antenna by physicist Joseph Weber was followed by false-alarm detections. NSF built LIGO in the face of skepticism by astronomers, and had to reorganize the project after an early management meltdown. Although the world of science today is more globally collaborative than competitive, there is still a place for national pride and strategic commitment. Just as Japanese scientists targeted neutrinos for their research in elementary particle physics and are proud of their great discoveries in that area (including a 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics), U.S. scientists can be proud of U.S. leadership in the discovery of gravitational waves. In \u201cThe Chirp Heard Across the Universe,\u201d the New York Times editorial board argued that the justification for NSF's billion-dollar investment in LIGO was simply curiosity about our place in the universe, with no expectation that it would lead to \u201ca better toaster.\u201d I agree, but that is not the whole story. Among federal science agencies, NSF is unique in its mission to fund discovery science; it is the throw-deep agency committed to satisfying the boundless curiosity of our species. And, if history is any guide, some of the new knowledge generated by these discoveries will result in future technological advances that transform our very existence. Michael Faraday's tinkering with magnetism in the 19th century led to the science that underpins everything that involves electricity and light, making good on his reply to British Chancellor of the Exchequer William Gladstone when asked about the utility of his research: \u201cOne day, sir, you may tax it.\u201d GW150914 may have been an ordinary event in the larger cosmos, but here on Earth, it marked an extraordinary scientific milestone by a very curious species.

Fisher v. the University of Texas about university admission policies regarding minority students, Chief Justice John Roberts asked, \u201cWhat unique perspective does a minority student bring to a physics class?\u201d As an African-American physicist researching string theory, and a teacher of university students since 1972, I have a response. Issues related to race in the United States have created barriers since the nation's founding, determining which citizens experience benefits, and which deprivations. This problem is not new for physicists. Albert Einstein's essay \u201cThe Negro Question\u201d includes \u201cWhat\u2026can the man of good will do to combat this deeply rooted prejudice? He must have the courage to set an example by word and deed, and must watch lest his children become influenced by this racial bias.\u201d Einstein described racism as a \u201cdisease,\u201d and he recommended principles to end discrimination, aligning with the O. Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, decision by the Supreme Court in 1954 to desegregate public schools. \u201c\u2026a different perspective is an asset in science\u2026\u201d Chief Justice Roberts' question\u2014premised on the idea that a person's background, including race, is irrelevant in science\u2014shows a fundamental misunderstanding of both science and human creativity. Science is a creative process, which is why the enterprise needs diverse thinking. The Chief Justice's physics class may have consisted of plugging numbers into equations to find how long a dropped ball takes to reach the ground. But today's science classes often strive for creative exploration and collaboration to foster innovation. This played out recently in my upper-level undergraduate class. Students worked in small groups to solve a problem involving vector calculus and group theory\u2014mathematics related to the discovery of subatomic particles such as the Higgs boson. In one group, two European-American students led discussions into a mathematical dead end. An African-American group member eventually wrote something on the board, which, when finally noticed, unstuck the group, and the problem was solved. Days afterward, the situation recurred, but this time, the group paid attention to the minority student, asking, \u201cHow did you come to that answer?\u201d The students learned more than vector calculus that day. The majority students understood that a different perspective is an asset in science, while the minority student gained peer creditability and confidence. Together, the members became more eficient as problem solvers. This is only an anecdote, but it shows what can happen in real-world classrooms. Several books have described the efficacy of diversity for the sake of innovation. For example, Scott E. Page explains that diversity's superiority emerges when a problem is difficult; that is, when no single individual always finds a solution, particularly in situations requiring creativity. In 1969, I entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) expecting to be different from most of the other new undergraduate students. Although often challenging, I found that my difference could be an advantage: Distinctive backgrounds can lead to different approaches to framing problems. If MIT had been legally bound then to admissions based solely on test scores, I would never have been admitted. It would have been a personal loss, but more importantly, unique mathematical and physics ideas created in my career, and tied to my idiosyncratic framing of problems, might never have seen the light of day. Minorities have made progress in science, as my own life attests. People of color and women are the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. college population. But discrimination continues. Each individual brings unique experiences that influence the capacity to move science forward in creative ways. Colleges need ways to recognize this in admissions processes. In the meantime, the Fisher v. Texas decision is poised to shape how and whether people like me can emerge in future science at its highest levels.

It is this promise that motivates my own investment, and I imagine that of others, in the new frontiers of bioscience. The complexity of biology is a fascinating challenge, and I am keen to see the field deconstruct its mysteries, establish reliable and predictive models, and put that knowledge to work. Such innovative and creative work drives human progress, and it is this belief that fuels my ongoing support for basic science. Toward this end, I've invested in the Allen Institute for Brain Science and the Allen Institute for Cell Science, and just last week launched the new Frontiers Group\u2014a part of the Allen Institute\u2014which supports researchers at academic institutions around the world. In recent years, organizations such as the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, W. M.

Such investments in bioscience are catalysts for change.

We should also be working more aggressively to break down scientific silos by backing more collaborative, interdisciplinary teams that include experts in bioscience, mathematics, computer science, medicine, engineering, and other fields. For example, the Human Genome Project succeeded because of the convergence of massive computing power, new algorithms, expertise in laboratory biology, and broad support from the public and private sectors. We need more of that, more often, to keep advancing bioscience. This type of bold, sweeping, integrative research inevitably entails the likelihood of setbacks and sometimes outright failure. As a consequence, some consider such science as too risky to support with the level of investments that I advocate. But what they fail to recognize is that the much larger risk to society lies in not committing enough to tackle the most complex or daunting frontiers. Without risk, there is rarely reward, and unless we attempt more \u201cbleeding edge\u201d approaches, efforts to prevent pandemics, defeat dementia, or cure cancer may take much longer than they should. We must do better, and we can. If we champion new research pioneers, cultivate a spirit of open collaboration, and aggressively fund science at the frontiers, the 21st century will ultimately yield answers to the biggest questions in bioscience.

Public opinion in the UK is split on a British exit from the EU, or a \u201cBrexit.\u201d A recent survey indicates that the majority of researchers favor the UK remaining in the EU.* As a British scientist and former Chief Scientific Adviser to the President of the European Commission, I believe that it benefits the UK, the EU, and global science for the UK to remain a strong committed member of the EU. \u201c\u2026it benefits the UK\u2026to remain a strong committed member of the EU.\u201d Established in 1951 to cement nations through common trade interests, the EU reflects a unified movement toward peace, prosperity, and stability. Now a family of 28 nations, this union shares economic goals and social and cultural values, and solves problems and exerts global influence through partnerships. As a result, the EU leads some of the most successful scientific enterprises in the world. A vote to leave the EU amounts to turning Britain's back on a demonstrably valuable venture that supports the UK's scientific success. The UK would face having a minor role in scientific endeavor rather than one of leadership and common vision. Science would survive, of course, and the UK could try to agree to terms with the remaining EU members (not a foregone conclusion) to secure \u201cassociated country\u201d status for major science projects such as Horizon 2020, the largest EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. But the UK would say goodbye to influence, and the ability to achieve scientific ambitions would diminish as it attempted to compete globally as a small island nation. Would this really matter? If the UK aspires to deliver a robust and sustainable economy fit for the 21st century, that economy must be based on science, engineering, and technology. It is difficult to see how that will be achieved if the best researchers in the UK are distanced from the best in Europe and other global partners. Science is an international pursuit. It relies on the best infrastructure, which cannot easily be delivered by single nations. British scientists currently have leadership roles in, and benefit from, the European Southern Observatory, the European Space Agency, the European Molecular Biology Laboratories, ITER (European nuclear fusion project), and ELIXIR (European infrastructure for biological information), to name a few. This involvement supports the UK's scientific aspirations, industries, and economy. The UK currently attracts the best scientists in the world, who understand that by being there, they can influence and take part in EU research programs, move freely between EU member states, form powerful scientific networks, and access the best infrastructure. It is hard to imagine that the UK would remain attractive to the best global scientific minds if distanced from the EU. Worse yet, would the UK close its borders to European scientists? Consider how the UK would deliver its European networks if the UK government chose not to replace funding received from Horizon 2020, an amount that substantially exceeds its proportionate contribution. Without doubt, there are challenges for the European Commission as it struggles to support the rapid expansion of the EU. Tensions about debt crises and immigration loom large over Europe. But what would a Brexit reflect as far as the British attitude toward an alliance that represents the hope of further strengthening stability and security? Rather, the UK should be working with its European partners to make the EU the best it can be. \u21b5* D. Cressy, Nature 531, 559 (2016).

Today, online communities such as PubPeer and Retraction Watch could be the first to raise an alert that a paper may require additional scrutiny. The involvement of such online entities has made the standardization of processes to address allegations more complex and has led to less patience from the scientific community and the public with what are often long timelines in institutional misconduct investigations. Editors are caught in the middle: They want to correct the literature as quickly as possible to avoid misleading readers with flawed information, but they also want to ensure that authors have received due process, even as rumors of scientific misconduct may be amplified through social media. Last month, a Journals Summit convened by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences tackled this topic in the larger context of research integrity, and several solutions emerged. \u201c\u2026rumors of scientific misconduct may be amplified through social media.\u201d Journals have their own requirements for author certification of the openness, transparency, and quality of a research paper and can take preemptive action to retract papers if the authors falsify those certifications, even before misconduct investigations have concluded. One example provided was a paper retracted based on lack of availability of the data, falsification of funding sources, and misrepresentation of approval by an institutional review board. In situations where a journal lacks authority to act, but preliminary evidence suggests that a paper will need to be retracted, an \u201ceditorial expression of concern\u201d can suitably alert the community that the results may be suspect, without the journal taking irreversible action. Although the summit attendees agreed that only institutions had the necessary access to conduct investigations, those institutions would benefit from the involvement and oversight of an experienced, independent party with no conflict of interest in the matter to speed up the process and ensure a quality outcome. Many participants felt that the stigma of having a retraction is so great that it might discourage authors from removing papers that are flawed because of honest errors. Finding some other terminology for such situations would help clean up the literature and reward good behavior. Should there be a statute of limitation on retractions? Two panelists had experiences as editors with requests to retract papers that were published more than 50 years ago. This clearly raises the question of due process. None of the authors were alive to respond to the charges of misconduct. Only incomplete records survived regarding how decisions about those papers were made. The requests were declined. Although panelists did not come up with a fixed amount of time beyond which a paper would be too old to retract, consideration of a paper's current influence and whether evidence exists to provide due process should weigh into the course of action in such cases. Editors are often caught in the crossfire between impatient readers who may reach conclusions about the validity of misconduct allegations on the basis of incomplete information online, and authors who are concerned about damage to their reputation. In the final analysis, the editor's paramount concern should be for the integrity of the scientific record.

As for more \u201croutine\u201d facilities, according to the latest version of NSF's biennial Survey of Science and Engineering Research Facilities, America's academic institutions invested over $3.7 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2012\u20132013 to revitalize science and engineering research labs, but at least another $8.3 billion is still needed. Using different survey methods, a study released in October 2015 by the Association of Public and Land Grant Universities concluded that reversing deferred but critical maintenance of U.S. agricultural research laboratories and pilot facilities alone would cost $3.2 billion. Modernizing research farm facilities would add another $1.25 billion. Updating current core research facilities is often seen as less glamorous than funding new major equipment and shareable facilities, but it is equally critical to any strategic plan for future science. This point was made well by the Department of Energy's FY 2016 Budget Request to Congress that asked for funds to upgrade facilities at the National Laboratories (as does the FY 2017 request, now wending its way through Congress). The magnitude of the overall costs to revitalize the country's research facilities means that no single stakeholder in the scientific enterprise can meet the needs alone. What is required is an organized partnership among research universities; local, state, and federal governments; private foundations; and private industry, all of which have a substantial stake in the future of science. A first step would be for leadership from either a governmental or nongovernmental organization to convene an influential group of partners and launch a comprehensive assessment of the nation's current research infrastructure. This should be followed by an action plan that lays out how the various partners will contribute to meet those needs. An inexact but relevant example may be the sequence of efforts set in motion by the U.S. National Academies' 2007 report Rising Above the Gathering Storm. The magnitude of collaborative effort needed to sustain the infrastructure is indeed daunting, and asking for major investment from the public and private sectors in the current budget climate may seem unrealistic. But allowing research facilities to crumble will inevitably stall the great scientific momentum enjoyed over the past 150 years.

More than 125 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, a level of suffering not seen since World War II. The social problems are wide and deep, from war and human trafficking to the gross inequality between the wealthy 1% and the poorest 3 billion of the population. Included in the summit's Agenda for Humanity are climate and natural disasters. Indeed, 1 year ago, Pope Francis emphasized, in the encyclical Laudato Si, that complex crises have both social and environmental dimensions. The bond between humans and the natural world means that we live in an \u201cintegral ecology,\u201d and as such, an integrated approach to environmental and social justice is required. \u201cThe real innovation is this new synergy between science, policy, and religion.\u201d The need for an integral ecology approach can be seen, for example, in the coupling of economic activities and wealth inequalities with environmental pollution and climate change. Climate pollutants come primarily from the wealthy 1 billion, but the worst consequences of associated climate change will be experienced by the bottom 3 billion, who had little to do with this pollution. Last year brought two historic global agreements that renewed optimism about a sustainable future. The United Nations' (UN's) declaration of sustainable development goals called for the eradication of poverty and the improvement of human well-being. The Paris agreement was signed by 195 nations to limit global warming to well below a 2\u00b0C increase. These global acknowledgements of systemic ecological and social problems have opened a window of opportunity to focus on how problems of poverty, human well-being, and the protection of creation are interlinked. The real innovation is this new synergy between science, policy, and religion. The origin, transformative potential, and future development of an alliance between science, policy, and religion is based on recent advances at the Holy See, which houses two Pontifical Academies devoted to science: one for natural scientists and the other for social scientists. The members of these academies are chosen not for their religious affiliations but for their scientific preeminence. In May 2014, the two academies of scholars, philosophers, and theologians met to contemplate the sustainability of humanity and nature, and came to a remarkable (for a scientific body) conclusion: The resolution of major environmental problems facing society requires a fundamental reorientation in our behavior and attitude toward nature and toward each other. Both academies convened faith leaders of the major religions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam (both Sunni and Shia), and Judaism to state that slavery and human trafficking are crimes against humanity. Although it is hard for different religions to pray at the same altar, it finally became possible and necessary for them to act together to defend the dignity of human beings and their common home. This new attitude spurred meetings in 2014 and 2015 between scientists, policy-makers, and religious leaders that included UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and governors and mayors from more than 80 large cities. The groups agreed that the mitigation of climate change was a moral and religious imperative, and that the development of a sustainable relationship with the planet also requires a moral revolution. This new alliance also declared that extreme globalization of forms of indifference such as human trafficking and modern slavery should be acknowledged as crimes against humanity. Pope Francis' effort to unite science, policy, and religion toward an integral ecology approach is just a start. We hope that other religions and moral and political leaders will join this new synergy and nudge society toward equitable solutions to ecological and social justice problems without losing sight of the values of the human person and the common good.

Implicit bias was the shorthand that allowed our distant ancestors to make split-second decisions (friend or foe?) based on incomplete information. It provided a razor-thin reaction-time advantage that could mean life or death. But today, we no longer need to assume that people who do not look or sound like us pose an immediate threat. Instead, successful organizations and people welcome those who do not necessarily look, think, and act like they do. They must overcome that implicit bias wired into the human DNA if they are to reap the benefits of diversity. To explore the extent of implicit bias in peer review, and what can be done to counter it, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS, the publisher of Science) recently convened a day-long forum of editors, publishers, funders, and experts on implicit bias in Washington, DC (see p. 1067). \u201c\u2026successful organizations and people welcome those who do not\u2026act like they do.\u201d From the journal perspective, there was some good news from a panel representing major journals. Scientific publishers such as the American Chemical Society (ACS) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU) find that female authors are published either at a rate proportional to that at which they submit to those journals, or at proportionally higher rates, as compared with their male colleagues. One expert on bias in peer review suggested that editors and program managers who make final decisions in single-blind review systems compensate for implicit bias to ensure an equitable outcome. However, when panelists examined international representation in the journals, they noted that publication rates are not proportional to the rates at which papers are submitted from various nations. Even for the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science (SPPS), which conducts double-blind peer review (removing information regarding country of origin, institution, and authors before review), data show that blinding is no assurance that geographic discrepancies will disappear. There are several possible explanations for the continued persistence of geographic disparities in acceptance rates, other than geographic variations in quality. For example, reviewers might infer the country of origin from other clues in the paper (such as field sites, special facilities, or use of English), even without names, institutions, and addresses. Moreover, all journal representatives participating in the panel (ACS, AGU, Nature, The New England Journal of Medicine, and SPPS) agreed that the reviewer pool is dominantly male and from the Western Hemisphere as compared to the author base. An interesting dichotomy arose among the journals regarding editorial staff. Journals staffed by professional full-time editors (Nature and Science) reported excellent gender balance, if not a tendency toward more female than male editors. The opposite situation exists for journals staffed by volunteer editors, likely driven by the greater demands on women's discretionary time. One possible direction, suggested by the forum, to reduce implicit bias is for journals to broaden, diversify, and internationalize their pool of editors and reviewers. Even journals already conducting double-blind reviews could benefit from such actions. This would allow a more equitable distribution of the reviewing process across a discipline's scientific community. To meet the demand, journals will need to devise new means of identifying a more diverse pool of experienced reviewers, or train a new cohort in the journal's expectations for review quality and reviewer ethics. Reviewers who repeatedly provide useful advice could eventually serve on editorial boards. Implicit bias is, by definition, subconscious, making it an easy issue for any individual to overlook or not even realize, and thus difficult to address. Some processes, such as double-blind review, attempt to overcome such prejudice, but blinding in all dimensions is a challenge. Building a peer evaluation system that is truly as diverse as the publication enterprise we desire would be a big step toward eliminating unfair bias that harms the scientific enterprise.

The editors at Science have held additional retreats and workshops to determine how best to adapt TOP to a general science journal and are now ready to announce our new standards, effective 1 January 2017.\u2020 \u201cThe editors at Science\u2026 are now ready to announce our new standards\u2026\u201d In implementing TOP, Science strives to find the right balance between encouraging better transparency about the evidence behind the authors' conclusions and respecting the broad array of norms and cultures across the many disciplines published in the journal. For example, we recognize that pre-registration of studies and analysis plans is becoming common-place in a few fields, such as clinical trials, and that many more studies would benefit from such practices. Preregistration of studies can help to avoid the \u201cfile drawer effect,\u201d in which investigations with null or inconclusive results are not disseminated, leading to a bias in the published literature toward positive, conclusive, and possibly spurious effects. Pre-registration of analysis plans reduces author bias in the interpretation of data. However, until more disciplines are ready to accept these approaches for hypothesis-testing research, it is premature for Science to insist that they be submitted. In terms of replications, Science will continue to publish such studies, holding them to the same standards as other content submitted to the journal. On the other hand, we believe the benefits of requiring the availability of data, code, and samples on which the authors' interpretations rest are worth the effort in compliance (and in some cases in adjusting data ownership expectations), while acknowledging that some special circumstances will require exemptions. This practice increases transparency, enables reproducibility, promotes data reuse, and is increasingly in line with funder mandates. We are also requiring the citation of all data, program code, and other methods not contained in the paper, using DOIs (digital object identifiers), journal citations, or other persistent identifiers, for the same reason. Citations reward those who originated the data, samples, or code and deposited them for reuse. Such a policy also allows accurate accounting for exactly which specific data, samples, or code were used in a given study. These guidelines also apply to our open-access journal Science Advances. The specialized journals that we publish\u2014Science Translational Medicine, Science Signaling, Science Immunology, and Science Robotics\u2014may have more specific expectations for design and analysis standards for those disciplines. Our editors are currently working out the fine print before posting detailed standards online. I have heard that some boards are struggling with how to implement TOP for their journals. They fear getting too far ahead of their communities in aspects such as requiring data availability from their authors. As part of the team that originally drafted the TOP guidelines, I encourage all journals to consider the flexibility of the TOP guidelines. For example, a journal need not require that all data be publicly available, but simply ask authors to declare whether the data are available. This information is very helpful for reviewers in terms of determining whether the study is likely to be replicable by a third party. Transparency, even without mandates, is a powerful tool. The benefits of implementing TOP extend well beyond the original goal of facilitating the replicability of published research. TOP creates a framework for sharing not just the findings of a study, but also the data, samples, code, and methods, which in many cases can outlive the findings in making durable contributions to science. \u21b5* B.

They now are ubiquitous on factory floors, build complex deep-sea installations, explore icy worlds beyond the reach of humans, and assist in precision surgeries. These robots are improving our health, adding to our scientific understanding, raising productivity, and performing tasks that humans cannot do. The rapid increase in the capabilities, varieties, and applications of robots has been built on scientific and engineering research into power and actuation systems, artificial intelligence, onboard navigation, environmental sensors, manipulators, control systems, novel materials, microfluidics, systems integration, and many other advances. With this growth, the research community that is engaged in robotics has expanded globally. To help meet the need to communicate discoveries across all domains of robotics research, we are proud to announce that Science Robotics is open for submissions. \u201cRobots\u2026will increasingly be intertwined with us\u2026\u201d One measure of the growth in the field of robotics is the increasing number and size of robotics conferences. Over a dozen prominent general robotics conferences are held annually at venues around the globe, with additional domain-specific conferences being convened as well. Online conference proceedings have traditionally served the role of journals for widely disseminating the material presented at conferences, giving credit to authors for their work, and archiving results. However, as the field has matured, publishers have launched new journals to more broadly communicate results to all interested scientists, regardless of their ability to attend conferences. Science Robotics aims to select the most groundbreaking advances in robotics across applications (such as medical, industrial, land, sea, air, space, and service), systems (such as propulsion, sensors, control, and navigation), and scales (from macro to nano) of general interest to the robotics research community and researchers working in allied fields (such as bio-inspired engineering, materials science, and novel sensing technologies). The goal is to move the field forward and cross-fertilize different research applications and domains. The Science Robotics Editorial Board will screen submissions for the most original research and then apply Science's rigorous peer-review process to ensure that the papers published are well worth reading. The journal will also publish invited reviews and will develop a forum to explore current policy, ethical, and social issues that affect the robotics community. We aim to make Science Robotics the must-read journal for the latest discoveries in robotics that will drive the next generation of robots. To this end, our editors welcome papers on relevant advances in other disciplines with a strong potential to revolutionize the design or operation of robots. Eventually, we plan to engage with robotics educational programs, using Science Robotics content. Authors are still encouraged to submit to Science outstanding robotics papers of interest to communities well beyond robotics researchers. We have a simple process for transferring robotics papers among the various relevant journals in the Science family (Science, Science Advances, Science Robotics, and for medical robotics, Science Translational Medicine) that permits the reuse of reviews if reviewers agree, speeding up the process of a paper being sequentially considered at multiple journals. Robotics is still a relatively young field. The problems prompting society to develop robotic systems to replace or extend human presence are unlikely to abate. For example, many nations face an aging population, with an insufficient number of young people to both care for the elderly and support the needs of the economy. Robots can accomplish some routine, dangerous, or high-precision jobs better than humans, thereby freeing people to do the tasks that robots cannot do. Robots are already part of our modern society and will increasingly be intertwined with us economically, technically, and perhaps, socially. Science Robotics seeks to help shape the future scientific, technical, ethical, and social aspects of that evolution.

Science Advances, our first foray into open-access publishing, is already into its second year and reaching a broad audience with premier content. Science Immunology will publish its first issue next month, and Science Robotics is open for submissions. I am grateful to two Chief Executive Officers (Alan Leshner and now Rush Holt), two past Publishers and one current one (Beth Rosner, Kent Anderson, and now Bill Moran), and the AAAS Board of Directors for supporting these new projects. The success of these ventures would not have been possible, however, without the dedication of the Science editors, who worked overtime to set up the processes and procedures for the new journals, helped select the new staff, and recruited quality content for these publications. Next, kudos to Rob Covey, Chief Digital Media Officer, and the digital media team for the redesign of the print journal (a blazing sprint!) and launching a more responsive web version of Science journals (more an endurance trial than a derby). Rob's team populated the new design with beautiful covers, photos, and videos. They have demonstrated that multimedia can drive traffic to articles and communicate the research story in new, compelling ways. Finally, all of us at Science have been on a crusade for the past 3 years to raise the standards for transparency and reproducibility in research, publishing a series of editorials, policy pieces, and research articles on this topic. Our special partners have been the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, the Center for Open Science, and many top publishers and funding agencies. The American Statistical Association helped us create a special Statistical Board of Reviewing Editors (S-BoRE) that is now being expanded to serve all Science journals. We recently announced our implementation of the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines, effective 1 January 2017. Our terrific News team at Science, led by Tim Appenzeller, has worked to ferret out and bring to light questionable practices in scientific publishing, such as paper brokers selling authorships, institutions offering bounties for publishing in high-impact journals, and publishers forgoing promised peer-review services. Our new product, PRE (Peer Review Evaluation), gives readers greater insight into the peer-review process for each article published. After such a wild ride, it was with some trepidation that I awaited the outcome of the search for my successor as editor-in-chief of the Science journals. The new journals still need a champion. The quest to improve the transparency and reproducibility of research and to remove any bias in access to scientific resources continues. Would the new editor care about these matters as much as I have? I am most pleased to say that the search committee, led by former AAAS Board chair Gerry Fink, has chosen very wisely. Professor Jeremy Berg is a superb pick to take the reins of the Science journals. He is highly respected and thoughtful, cares about what is important, commands an exceptionally broad view of science, and is a very quick study.

Now, with many bridges burned\u2014or at least charred\u2014where do political leaders go next? Politicians in the UK and EU are going to need every available foundation on which to rebuild trust and mutual interests. They will need to discover once again how to work in partnership. It will be a long and difficult process; one in which science should play a crucial role. \u201c\u2026science [has] enormous potential as a foundation for \u2026a new relationship between the EU and the UK.\u201d The referendum provoked rousing exchanges, but there were also many calm analyses, notably from the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee and the Royal Society. The overwhelming majority of UK scientists supported membership in the EU at every stage of the debate, while opinion in the wider population was clearly divided. University leaders (who seldom reach consensus on anything) called with one voice for the UK to remain in the EU. A community of nations with a common framework for funding research, establishing priorities, sharing facilities, and moving people and ideas across borders brings advantages to its scientific community. Compromises, challenges, and regulatory burdens come as part of the package but, on balance, British scientists found the EU an enormously attractive feature of our continent. Those attractions remain. Now, there is scope for science as one of the starting points for the critical process of building a new relationship between the EU and the UK. Existing commitments alone mean that UK science will have a major role in Europe for years to come. For example, the EU's Joint European Torus, located near Oxford, provides vital expertise to the much larger ITER nuclear fusion facility under construction in France. Also, EU-funded infrastructures for social science, biological data, and radio astronomy are based in the UK, and countless robust EU research programs depend on UK leadership and collaborations. Right now, over 18% of funding returned to the UK from EU resources is for R&D, making this one of the larger parts of the EU's relationship with the UK. Thus, many thousands of relationships between students, academics, and administrators bind together scientists in the UK and other European countries. All of this gives science enormous potential as a foundation for building a new relationship between the EU and the UK. But foundations are no use if they are undermined by political wrangling. There will need to be investment of time, political capital, and money to bolster the science UK-EU bridge. British scientists must now work hard to urge policy-makers to promote continued scientific collaborations and advise on how to move ahead. Maybe the UK's next prime minister should offer to host new international research facilities along with the EU, or increase the support the UK gives to UK businesses and universities considering EU collaborations. Perhaps further research fellowships for talented scientists wishing to collaborate or move across the EU could be launched. These are not hollow gestures: They would bring benefits in their own right as well as rebuild trust. The scientific community could brainstorm such possibilities and work closely with the government on next steps. Indeed, wise policy-makers understand that R&D develops people for the wider labor market, creates new products and businesses, and makes huge contributions to health care, defense, the natural environment, and public services. These benefits are built on strong collaborative science. One of the great strengths of UK science is its international culture and the recognition that the best minds, wherever they are from, can together tackle shared challenges. Leaving the EU does not mean an end of this quality, but it requires profound changes in the practicalities behind it.

When I was a teenager, I talked to him about careers. I love math, even fairly esoteric stuff. He surprised me by saying, \u201cMath is something to pursue only if you cannot imagine doing anything else. You can follow other careers and still do math, but pure math can be very isolating; only a few people in the world are likely to really understand what you are working on.\u201d I was surprised that he was discouraging me from his career path. But wait, what? He was also implying that science was a social activity in an essential way. \u201c\u2026science is, indeed, a profoundly social activity.\u201d I took his advice and pursued chemistry, driven in part by my interest in geometry and three-dimensional structures. Over my career, I have moved from chemistry to structural biology and crystallography, to synthetic inorganic chemistry, back to structural biology, to biophysics, to biochemistry, to informatics, to computational biology, and to personalized medicine. Along the way, I also have had great opportunities to lead scientific organizations. I helped build a department of biophysics and directed the most fundamental science-focused institute at the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), with programs spanning the basic biomedical and related sciences, key clinical areas such as anesthesiology, and research training. With regard to the clinical areas, my expertise has been greatly bolstered by \u201chome schooling\u201d in clinical research by my wife, Wendie Berg, an accomplished breast imaging researcher and clinician who has run several major clinical trials. While at NIH, I had many intense discussions with a colleague about the social science research relevant to developing inclusive training programs. He would frequently challenge me with results that did not fit my intuition. He had the habit of adding aphorisms to his email signature block, and one of my favorites was, \u201cDon't believe everything you think.\u201d This directive nicely captures the power of the scientific method. If you have an idea, you can collect data and analyze them to determine whether your observations are consistent with your hypothesis or refute it. I, like most practicing scientists, have had my eyes opened when an attractive hypothesis was demolished by an incisive experiment. Returning to my father's comment, science is, indeed, a profoundly social activity. Many hypotheses come not from single individuals but from groups with individuals at different career stages and with diverse interests, discussing previous results and ideas. Small or large teams of researchers perform many experiments. Other scientists then review the results, critically examining the experiments, analyses, and interpretation. All of this is conducted in a highly competitive environment where personal satisfaction, funding, recognition, and career stability often depend on being the \u201cfirst\u201d to make an advance, creating tension with collaborative efforts. It is daunting to be added to the list of incredibly impressive individuals who have previously served as editor-in-chief. Most recently, Marcia McNutt has led the Science journals admirably over her relatively short tenure. She is leaving only because her accomplishments led to another amazing opportunity, and the scientific community is fortunate to have her as president of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. The position of the editor-in-chief of Science and the other journals of the Science family presents both a tremendous opportunity and an intimidating responsibility. Science is a key tool in addressing the pressing problems facing humankind and our planet. To make progress, scientists must engage with the public, policy-makers, and many other groups. Scientists must communicate their results fairly and listen to the perspectives of others.

The vote for Britain's exit (\u201cBrexit\u201d)\u2014with worrying repercussions for European science and wider society\u2014and questions about the plans of the new UK Prime Minister Theresa May, will inevitably cast a shadow over proceedings. But as Jerzy Langer, chair of ESOF's program committee, argues, the meeting has now acquired a sharper purpose: to demonstrate at a time of acute uncertainty that \u201cwe, the scientists, are one big family, whose rules and values extend beyond political and geographic borders.\u201d \u201c\u2026 a strong focus on science policy\u2026 is more important than ever.\u201d Concern about the implications of Brexit for science has focused primarily on the obstacles it may pose to continued collaboration and free movement of researchers across Europe. However, the dense web of connections between British and European science extends into many other areas, including science policy and the provision of evidence and expert advice to decision-makers. One example is the European Commission's Scientific Advice Mechanism (SAM), announced last year by Carlos Moedas, the Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation. After an open nomination process, a high-level group of seven advisers was appointed and began its work in January 2016. Supported by a Brussels secretariat, the SAM will also procure advice from networks of national academies and learned societies across Europe. The SAM's first two projects\u2014on CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles; and digital identities and cybersecurity\u2014are well advanced, and on target to release findings before the end of 2016. It also recently published an explanatory note on the safety and risks of the herbicide glyphosate, which remains a vexed issue in Europe. Henrik Wegener, inaugural chair of the SAM's high-level group, has emphasized the need for it to work in an independent, transparent, and consultative way. In support of this goal, its next meeting will take place at ESOF, providing a first opportunity for the wider research community to engage with the SAM's work. A summit meeting this September of the International Network for Government Science Advice will be hosted in Brussels by the European Commission, at which the SAM will play a prominent role. These are still early days for the SAM. It has met just twice, and its initial priorities were proposed by Brussels policy-makers. It is envisaged that the SAM will soon begin to work in both reactive and proactive ways, and the high-level group has developed a long list of potential topics and questions where it could make a meaningful contribution to European Union (EU) decision-making. How it strikes a balance between independence and policy relevance, and how far it gets drawn into the more contested terrain between evidence, policy, and politics, remain to be seen. Even before Brexit, the ESOF meeting intended a strong focus on science policy. In the present climate, this is more important than ever. The vocal dismissal of evidence and expertise during what some described as the UK's \u201cpost-fact\u201d referendum on the EU raises the possibility of a reversal of progress toward more evidence-informed decision-making. There is a risk that such a trend will spread to other fields and become more prominent in European political discourse, and that the research community will adopt overly defensive or dismissive positions. Argument and analysis of events over the past month will be prominent at ESOF, but answers are likely to require a more searching period of reflection. Hopefully, the SAM can provide one arena through which these debates move forward within Britain, across Europe, and beyond.

I lauded women working in astrophysics, government, and science policy in the United States and elsewhere, but said that progress was mixed\u2014the veneer of success for women across the sciences, and in science leadership, was too thin across the globe. What has changed since then? Cultural barriers, a lack of enlightened policies, and the need for role models and support systems still exist worldwide. However, today there is good reason to be optimistic. The international scientific community is coming together intentionally to acknowledge and tackle gender equity. \u201c\u2026global equity for women in science\u2026is a call to action.\u201d This year, I made my first trip as the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) director to the Next Einstein Forum (NEF) in Africa, where I was on a panel discussing women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Scientists, engineers, and innovators from across the continent\u2014women and men\u2014all were hungry for change and fighting for equality. A resulting declaration committed to prioritizing the enrollment of women in STEM programs at the tertiary and postgraduate levels in Africa. I also was in India for the annual meeting of the Global Research Council (GRC), where heads of research funding agencies took up the issue of gender equity in STEM research. Even though I was the only woman (until then) on the 12-member governing board, everyone agreed to a statement of actions that countries could implement to further gender equity in STEM fields, including gender considerations in research design and analysis. The GRC board committed to collect and share data to chart progress. The global economy, too, is now being viewed through a gender equity lens. Japan, host country of the May 2016 G7 Science and Technology Ministers' Meeting of leading industrial nations, is encouraging G7 nations to lead efforts in \u201cinclusive innovation\u201d to ensure that everyone accesses and benefits from science and technology. Further, the final G7 report encourages the development of \u201cpolicy and working environments in which equal opportunity allows women to exert their abilities [and] advance their career prospects.\u201d Such changes help STEM equality and will attract and retain talented women in STEM careers. What about the United States? Women now earn about half of all science and engineering bachelor's degrees, yet they account for only 30% of the U.S. science and engineering workforce. In some STEM fields, such as mechanical engineering, the percentage of women is in the single digits. NSF will continue to advance equity through data-driven decision-making. Our Career\u2013Life Balance Initiative, for example, mitigates factors that can negatively affect women's ability to carry out research, especially during the early years of their careers. NSF's ADVANCE program encourages universities to use institutional data about recruitment and retention to develop structural changes to improve representation and advancement of women. These deliberate actions by NSF complement the research that NSF supports in the science and practice of STEM gender equity. Projects range from computer programming camps to encourage girls, to studies on creating classroom environments that attract and retain female students. One of our newest initiatives, NSF INCLUDES, is fostering innovative alliances and networks that can scale up effective methods for addressing shortages and broadening the participation of women and others who are underrepresented in STEM fields. Ensuring global equity for women in science and engineering research requires personal commitment to action within one's own sphere of influence. It is a call to action we all must embrace.

An important, but certainly imperfect, measure of impact is the number of times that a paper is cited over time. Citation numbers for individual papers can be aggregated to develop indices that are used to evaluate the content of journals or productivity over the course of a career. Although these indices are convenient, it is important to examine them critically to avoid their misuse. \u201c\u2026how should one's publications be judged?\u201d A case in point is the journal impact factor (JIF), defined as the average number of times that articles published in a journal over the past 2 years are cited in a given year. JIF was developed as a metric to evaluate journals for, as an example, library resource allocation. As described recently, JIF values are based on broad and skewed distributions of citations.* I have extended these observations in my new Science blog, Sciencehound (http://blogs.sciencemag.org/sciencehound/). In my first post, I develop a mathematical function that captures the key features of the citation distributions. Subsequent posts will examine how these distributions can be used to address statistical questions regarding papers from journals with different JIF values. This analytical framework enables one to quantitatively assess the utility and, most importantly, the limitations of the use of JIFs. As an example, take Science, with an impact factor for 2015 of 34.7. What is the probability that a randomly chosen paper from Science will have more citations than a paper randomly chosen from another journal with a JIF of 30? Modeling (to be discussed in Sciencehound) suggests a probability of 53%, barely different from chance. What about journals with JIFs of 20, 10, or 5? These probabilities are estimated to be 62%, 80%, and 91%, respectively. Even with a spread of 30 in the average number of citations per paper, the probability for concluding that a paper from one journal will have more citations than a paper from another does not reach the usual criterion of a P value below 0.05 used to judge statistical significance. Despite this lack of discriminating power, JIFs are sometimes (ab)used to judge individual papers or scientists in some institutions around the world. The presumption is that comparison of the JIF of the journal in which a given paper appears with that from other journals or against some other standard provides substantial insight about the impact of that paper. Given the analysis of the citation distributions, this presumption is clearly invalid as a matter of mathematical fact. Thus, JIFs should not be a component of key decision processes such as faculty recruitment or promotion. This concern is independent of other criticisms regarding the robustness of JIFs, such as those noted in the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment,\u2020 of which the American Association for the Advancement of Science (the publisher of Science) is a signatory. If using JIFs to assess faculty is excluded, how should one's publications be judged? If a numerical metric is desired, the number of citations for a paper can be useful. This is a more direct measure of impact, particularly if factors such as the time since publication and comparative citation data from other papers in the same field are taken into consideration. More subjective measures can also be very important. Opinions about the impact of particular papers or a body of work rendered by qualified scientists in the same or similar fields have traditionally played an important role, and this should continue, ideally with appropriate consideration of potential sources of conscious or unconscious bias from these referees. Who knows? Perhaps those charged with making these important decisions should read the papers themselves, assuming that their area of expertise is close enough to the field under consideration. \u21b5* www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/07/05/062109.full.pdf. \u21b5\u2020 www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf ", "abstract": "", "introduction": "", "discussion": ""}, "28": {"type": "Editorial", "title": "EIT's teething problems", "author": ["Helga Nowotny", "Jana Kolar"], "authorInstitution": ["Helga Nowotny is former president of the ERC and professor emerita at ETH, Zurich, Switzerland.", "Jana Kolar is executive director of Central European Research Infrastructure Consortium and a member of the governing board of the EIT."], "publisher": "American Association for the Advancement of Science", "date": "2016/08/12", "doi": "10.1126/science.aah6973", "pdfLink": "/content/353/6300/627.full.pdf", "textLink": "/content/353/6300/627.full.txt", "text": "Good policy intentions do not always translate into the desired outcome. Nearly a decade ago, the European Commission (EC) launched two new entities with the goal of building a European-wide ecosystem\u2014one to support frontier research, the European Research Council (ERC), and the other to boost innovation, the European Institute of Technology (EIT). Today, the ERC is considered the gold standard for funding frontier research of scientific excellence, with a budget that almost doubled in 2014 under Horizon 2020, the European Union Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. What about the EIT? While acknowledging the progress made, an April report by the European Court of Auditors states that the EIT's overly complex operational structure and past management problems have impeded its overall effectiveness. In fact, continuous evaluations and adjustments will probably be needed to turn it into a success. \u201c\u2026EIT holds important lessons for the future.\u201d In 2005, EC President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso proposed the EIT as a European beacon for facilitating innovation. The EIT should become a rallying point for industry, research, and education across the extremely diverse innovation landscape in Europe. Reservations arose immediately about the EIT's fit into already existing structures and schemes, inadequate funding, and the time required for such an entity to mature. The latter proved particularly true. Although both the ERC and EIT had to navigate the bureaucratic maze of EC rules, the EIT has experienced considerably more growing pains. This is not surprising, given that it aims to create an innovation ecosystem, which is a far more arduous task than supporting frontier research. As it turned out, the EIT's structure would mirror the complexities to be confronted. Its main operative instruments are competitively selected Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), which nurture entrepreneurial students through EIT-labeled study programs at universities. In addition to this academic arm, a wealth of EIT activities foster joint research between business and academia, create innovative companies, and support their growth. To accomplish all of these missions, KICs were set up as legal entities, giving them flexibility to tailor support for the needs of entrepreneurs and companies. But KICs were also intended to develop strategies for financial sustainability. Given that the European innovation system is dominated by a multitude of granting schemes for different purposes, this goal is ambitious, if not unrealistic. In its report, the auditors in particular expressed doubts about the financial sustainability of the KICs. They also found the mechanism of annual grant cycles ill suited for the KICs' multiannual activities. They urged several regulatory and operational adjustments of the EIT if expectations are to be fulfilled. For example, EIT funding may only cover a maximum of 25% of a KIC's overall costs, whereas complementary activities are covered from other sources, even ERC grants. The auditors found that there is little added value to this funding condition, which unnecessarily complicates reporting. Arguably, igniting a new entrepreneurial spirit across universities stands out as the EIT's most substantial contribution thus far. Nevertheless, the search continues for an instrument that can address innovation as successfully as the ERC supports excellent science. In 2014, the EC launched the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises instrument to fund high-potential innovation. Earlier this year, a public consultation for setting up a European Innovation Council, inspired by the success of the ERC, was carried out by Research, Science and Innovation Commissioner Carlos Moedas. It is too early to know the outcome of these attempts to boost Europe's performance in innovation, or how they will complement the EIT. In the meantime, continuous monitoring, analysis, and adaptation of the EIT's efforts may lead to a uniquely European facilitator of innovation. It is clear that no single, magic solution exists. As a part of the larger innovation ecosystem still under construction, the EIT holds important lessons for the future.

These bills will only focus on one fiscal year. Yet, almost all scientific projects require years to yield substantial progress. This timeline may favor longer-term budget allocation and other policy adjustments. Science-funding agencies typically make multiyear grants, with averages of approximately 3 years for the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and 4 years for the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). For the NIH and, to a lesser extent, NSF, these grants are paid out over consecutive years. Thus, when an agency makes an award, it often takes on a \u201cmortgage\u201d for funding the grant in future years. This approach allows agencies to monitor research efforts effectively through progress reports. However, multiyear funding means that the likelihood that applications submitted in subsequent years will be funded (often measured by \u201csuccess rates\u201d or \u201cfunding rates\u201d) will depend largely on decisions made in previous years. Transitions from years with relatively generous appropriations (in which many new grants can be awarded) to those with limited appropriations can result in large drops in success rates. \u201c\u2026ground-breaking research may be missed for arbitrary reasons of timing.\u201d Such fluctuations have important consequences. Outstanding applications that would have been funded one year go unsupported the next year, so that potentially ground-breaking research may be missed for arbitrary reasons of timing. Low success rates result in scientists spending more time writing and reviewing proposals instead of conducting research. Investigators, particularly those at vulnerable career stages, can become demoralized by the apparently capricious nature of funding decisions. I have constructed a quantitative model that estimates grant success rates based on past appropriation levels, described in Sciencehound (http://blogs.sciencemag.org/sciencehound/2016/08/26/modeling-success-rates). The first component of the model estimates the number of grants that can be awarded annually based on the appropriations history. Remarkably, a simple model that captures only the essential features of multiyear funding reproduces year-to-year patterns quite well. The second component estimates the number of grant applications reviewed each year, based on the observation that increases in agency appropriations usually result in increases in subsequent application numbers with a 1- to 2-year lag. The NIH budget doubled from 1998 through 2003 but has been nearly flat ever since. The model, applied from 1990 to 2015, reproduces the drop in the success rate (from approximately 30 to 20%) that occurred over the 2 years after the doubling. The success of the model supports the hypothesis that basic features of grant-funding processes were responsible for this drop rather than changes in NIH policies. A benefit of these models is that consequences of potential alternative appropriation scenarios can be examined in quantitative terms. Suppose that Congress had increased the NIH appropriation from 1998 to 2015 at a constant rate instead of the \u201cboom\u201d of the doubling and the \u201cbust\u201d of the flat funding, with the same overall constant dollar investment. The model suggests that this would have resulted in 2.4-fold smaller fluctuations in success rates and a decrease of nearly 35,000 unsuccessful grant applications. Thus, with a more stable funding stream, the system would have been more equitable on a year-to-year basis, and an average of 1300 fewer applications would have needed to be written and peer-reviewed per year to support the same amount of research. Scientists and other advocates often call for steady increases in science budgets, arguing that growth at the rate of inflation is necessary to maintain research activity and that predictable budgets allow longer-term planning. These are important arguments, but they apply to many sectors. The multiyear nature of science funding provides an additional compelling argument for the implementation of longer-term science budget planning by the scientific community and the government.

This well-worn, long-standing question reflects the fact that the answer is not simple. Later this month in Brussels, scientists and policy-makers will convene at the International Network for Government Science Advice (INGSA) Forum to consider the most promising ways forward. \u201c\u2026the place of scientific evidence in policy-making is neither straightforward nor guaranteed\u2026\u201d Scientists are often perplexed by the apparent failure of their evidence to affect policy. Despite years of accumulated evidence for anthropogenic climate change, policy-makers have been slow to react. The public health community is frustrated that few countries have adopted effective measures to address obesity. In these and other cases, evidence is often contested, and the policy responses are incremental at best. But policy-makers, too, are vexed by scientists' ability to identify problems, yet frequent inability to place their work in the context of timely and feasible policy solutions. Often forgotten is that policy-making is messy. Although a tidy, analytically driven cycle of policy-making might seem logical to scientists trained in the tradition of hypothesis generation and testing, policy-making is instead a networked process in which scientific evidence is only one of many inputs. The notion of \u201cevidence\u201d comes in multiple forms. Public opinion polls and anecdotes are often considered \u201cevidence\u201d for a certain course of action. Policy decisions involve balancing empirical data with other arguments. The place of science is distinguished from other policy inputs by its relative objectivity obtained through formal processes designed to limit bias in data collection and analysis. Much scientific and societal debate emerges because of different views on evaluating the sufficiency of evidence on which to draw conclusions. Moreover, the issues for which scientific input is most needed by policymakers are the very ones for which the science is often the most complex, multidisciplinary, and incomplete. In the absence of easily digestible scientific evidence, Wikipedia can become a policy analyst's best friend. And with the new lure of big data promising policy-relevant revelations, the need to ensure that policy-makers avoid analytical pitfalls is pressing. Providing scientific advice to government takes place within an ecosystem. It is a combination of actors who are both internal and external to government, with advice that is formal and informal. All of this comes in many guises and is conditioned by context. For instance, there will be different mechanisms for regulatory advice, program development, and cabinet-level decision-making. The latter often occur as informal conversations and brainstorming at opportune moments. National emergencies, by contrast, require instant scientific input through formal channels linked closely to crisis management and risk communication. For more slow-burning policy questions, internal advisors can ensure the integrity of science while those from outside government\u2014such as academies\u2014are a critical source of analysis and commentary. But does such an ecosystem not risk becoming a cacophony of complicated claims for the policy-maker? One way forward is to establish principles that underpin effective science advisory mechanisms across all these dimensions and to build capacity on both the supply and demand sides of advisory processes. INGSA is dedicated to doing exactly this. The network brings together advisers, policy-makers, and scholars from more than 70 countries, with the goal of improving knowledge and practice at the interface of science and public policy. With the science-intensive United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, climate change, and other global challenges now part of many countries' policy discourse, the INGSA Forum will facilitate much-needed dialogue. Although the place of scientific evidence in policy-making is neither straightforward nor guaranteed, our commitment to it has never been more important.

The need for a safe and effective vaccine is immediate. Yet, like the Ebola epidemic 2 years ago, we find ourselves without a vaccine to combat this latest threat. When surveillance points to a possible emergence of a new infectious disease of potential public health importance, we need procedural and funding mechanisms that can quickly identify candidate vaccines and drive research and development toward licensure and production. Even if such a vaccine is not yet licensed, having it ready for immediate large trials when a regional crisis occurs will be a major advantage over our current reactive system. \u201cHow much more incentive is needed to develop candidate vaccines?\u201d Two years ago, amidst the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, the international health community was laser-focused on finding an effective and safe vaccine. By heroic public health actions and luck, the crisis was curtailed without one. Today, hardly a word is mentioned about that crisis or the current status of vaccine development. Yet tomorrow, we could experience another explosive Ebola epidemic that begins in the slums of one of equatorial Africa's megacities and spreads in deadly waves, where only the availability of an effective vaccine could halt its ruinous progression. Now, Zika transmission in Florida dominates news in the United States, along with partisan political theater regarding government funding for the country's response. However, we must not take our eye off the most pressing problem of Zika: the explosive transmission in the Americas outside the continental United States. For example, it is estimated that up to 5% of Puerto Rico's population is getting infected with Zika each month, including thousands of pregnant women, for whom infection could result in fetal microcephaly. I fear the road to a Zika vaccine may be long and bumpy. Despite optimistic predictions, demonstrating safety will be an immense challenge. It likely will be necessary to conduct studies involving many thousands of participants to determine if Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), a serious autoimmune condition caused by natural Zika virus, is also related to vaccine candidates. And recent follow-up of a vaccine efficacy study for dengue, Zika's cousin flavivirus, suggests a diminishing vaccine-induced antibody response over time. This means that antibody-dependent enhancement disease may occur upon infection with a new dengue strain, or possibly even another flavivirus such as Zika or yellow fever. The handwriting is on the wall regarding the current Zika outbreak in the Americas. High human infection rates in the major impact regions, caused by virus-carrying mosquitoes and human sexual transmission, will continue for several more years. Eventually, the number of cases will drop as more of the community develops immunity. Zika vaccine trials in the Americas may be too late to be tested on the current high number of cases. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is a new international effort that includes the Wellcome Trust; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; World Economic Forum; U.S., Indian, and Norwegian governments; GAVI; academic researchers; international vaccine manufacturers; and the World Health Organization. CEPI (www.cepi.net) is the best hope to fill the vaccine preparedness hole. These experiences demand better answers than our current vaccine research, development, manufacturing, and distribution system has provided. Based on observation, we could, and should, have anticipated that agents like Zika and Ebola virus would emerge as serious pathogens. The 2013 to 2014 Zika outbreak in French Polynesia produced nearly 9000 suspected cases and a strong association with GBS. How much more incentive is needed to develop candidate vaccines? With the growth of megacities in the developing world and prevalence of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in many areas, this disease should not have come as a surprise\u2014nor should the host of others yet to come that we would be foolish not to expect.

Notwithstanding, few entomologists communicate with the public about their work. This relationship is a major problem for two reasons. Finding new solutions to evolving insect-related challenges requires basic research, but fundamental insect science often appears arcane and irrelevant to the general public and policy-makers. Also, when basic knowledge produces new technology, that novelty can generate widespread public concern and even entrenched opposition to implementation. One example, the sterile insect technique, is as mystifying to most people today as it was 80 years ago. In 1935, charged with controlling the screwworm fly, a devastating pest of livestock, entomologists Edward Knipling and Raymond Bushland commenced decades-long studies of its sexual behavior and population biology. Skepticism abounded when, in 1953, merging their findings with Hermann Muller's Nobel Prize-winning discovery that irradiation sterilizes male fruit flies, they released thousands of irradiated male screwworm flies on Cura\u00e7ao, where livestock losses to the pest were unmanageable. In just 7 months, the breeding cycle was fatally disrupted, and screwworms were eradicated from the island with no adverse consequences. By 1966, the sterile insect technique had eradicated screwworms from the United States, saving the cattle industry millions of dollars in annual losses. Yet despite its demonstrable utility, funding for screwworm eradication in Central America by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (to prevent incursions northward into the United States) in 2005 was described as \u201cgetting \u2018screwed\u2019 by the government\u201d in The Pig Book: How Government Wastes Your Money. Today, mosquito biologists have modernized sterile insect release, creating transgenic males that pass lethal genes to offspring, decimating populations harboring Zika and other viruses. Still, public distrust of genetically modified organisms is so pervasive that a survey in February revealed that 35% of Americans believe (mistakenly) that such mosquitoes (\u201cFranken-flies\u201d) are responsible for Zika's spread. As the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers the use of such insects for Zika control, there is public concern that they could have unintended effects on the environment. These two examples illustrate the continuing need for clearer communication with the public about how new science enhances pest management efforts. Last March, the Entomological Society of America and the Sociedade Entomol\u00f3gica do Brasil held a summit in Brazil to discuss research and management strategies for A. aegypti, which transmits Zika, chikungunya, and dengue viruses. One outcome of this meeting was a consensus to improve communication with the public through strategies that are tailored for each country to best disseminate facts and dispel misinformation that hinders responses to disease outbreaks. The Leadership Summit at this year's ICE meeting will build on this message most opportunely, at the largest gathering of entomologists in the discipline's history. The world's entomologists need to talk among themselves about how best to talk about insect science with the rest of the world.

During the 20th century, their financing complemented the steady federal support that U.S. research and development (R&D) enjoyed, particularly in basic science. Regrettably, such government funding turned stagnant in the 21st century. Federal support of R&D at higher education institutions has fallen over 11% since 2011, the longest multi-year decline in federal funding for academic R&D since data collection began in 1972. What does this mean for achieving breakthrough discoveries in science? To solve some of our greatest societal problems, we not only need to focus on basic science research\u2014we also need sufficient resources and new approaches. Basic research allows innovative thinkers in science and engineering to work toward ambitious and important goals, including in biomedicine. This was certainly the case in cancer research, where substantial progress was made once scientists had gained sufficient understanding of gene structure and function to support translational thinking and convert basic findings into cures. However, without adequate resources, great visions cannot be fulfilled. Although private funding cannot match the scale of government funding (the U.S. National Institutes of Health alone is allocated $30 billion per year), it can help fill gaps. Most importantly, it can initiate research thrusts into unproven directions, which generally do not draw government funding. New approaches are also required. Chan and Zuckerberg will direct their first science-focused investment to establish a \u201cBiohub\u201d that marries engineering and life sciences research from multiple institutions. Based in San Francisco's Mission Bay, this hub will draw on the talented scientists and engineers from the University of California at Berkeley and at San Francisco, and Stanford University. Its proximity to the technologists of Silicon Valley is an asset as well. Future scientific advances likely will be at the interface of different disciplines\u2014a \u201cconvergence\u201d that requires breaking down barriers between fields. This is exactly what Biohub is planning. Such cross-disciplinary, open, and collaborative research also has been envisioned by other philanthropists, including Eli and Edythe Broad when the Broad Institute was organized in 2004. In 2012, the Science Philanthropy Alliance was launched (for which I am an advisor) to shepherd private giving for basic research. Drawing on the expertise of foundations, philanthropists, and scientists across fields of basic research, the Alliance helps philanthropists make forays into supporting creative basic research. Indeed, Chan and Zuckerberg spoke with a wide range of scientists (including me) and philanthropists from around the world, through the Alliance network, to better understand where their intervention could make important things happen that otherwise would languish. They have dared to think big, and I encourage philanthropists to engage with the scientific community for advice. This year has already seen billions of philanthropic dollars go to science, including from Paul Allen to support bioscience, Sean Parker to advance cancer immunotherapy research, Sandy and Joan Weill for brain research, and Yuri Milner for the study of our universe. These dollars will play an important role in scientific progress. Big-profile gifts raise concerns for some, such as downplaying the need to increase federal dollars for basic research. But these gifts are certainly broadcasting a common message\u2014philanthropists recognize that a long view of progress is worth investing in.

For decades, the private sector has withdrawn from some areas of basic research, as accelerating market pressures, the speed of innovation, and the need to protect intellectual property in a global marketplace made a Bell Labs\u2013style, in-house model of discovery and development hard to sustain. However, the leaders who gathered for the \u201cCEOs and Leaders for Science\u201d retreat* (which we convened) agreed that basic research will make or break corporations in the long term. Why? Long-term basic research, substantially funded by the U.S. government, underlies some of industry's most profitable innovations. Global positioning system technology, now a staple in every mobile phone, emerged from Cold War Defense Department research and decades of National Science Foundation explorations. As well, long-term public\u2013private partnerships in basic research have driven U.S. leadership, from information technology to drug development and medical advancement. For example, the Human Genome Project combined $14.5 billion in federal investment with a private-sector initiative, generating nearly $1 trillion in jobs, personal wealth for entrepreneurs, and taxes by 2013. Such endeavors created a science ecosystem that in turn generated the talent pipeline upon which it depended. Although for-profit corporations still invest in proprietary product development and expensive clinical trials, industry finds itself unable to invest in basic research the way it once did. The need for increased corporate secrecy, market force\u2013driven short-term decision-making, and narrowing windows to monetize new technologies have whittled away industry's willingness and ability to conduct basic research. This change threatens U.S. preeminence in research. For instance, the nation may lose its ability to attract and retain the finest talent from around the world. A good fraction of the students who earn advanced degrees in science and technology in the United States come from abroad because of the nation's scientific excellence. For decades, American companies could attract and retain the finest talent from around the world. But if the U.S. loses its edge in research, it may also lose this vital resource of expertise and innovation. Consequently, business leaders assembled at Sunnylands resolved to use their individual and collective credibility, and their stature as heads of enterprises that fuel the economy, to advocate for greater government support for basic scientific research to revitalize the science ecosystem. However, they will need to lift sagging public opinion because many Americans now see basic research as a luxury rather than a necessity. A 2015 Pew poll found that Americans who view publically funded basic research as \u201cnot worth it\u201d rose from 18 to 24% between 2009 and 2014. At the same time, those who believe private investment is enough to ensure scientific progress also increased from 29 to 34%. With that in mind, the CEOs will partner with academic leaders to educate the public about the importance of basic research. Together, they will advocate for this in meetings with federal officials, through various media channels, and by asking presidents in the Association of American Universities to identify corporate leaders in their respective communities to join the effort. The hope is that this concerted action positions basic research atop the next U.S. president's agenda. History has shown that investments in basic research are the primary engine by which humanity has advanced, and major economic gains\u2014often unanticipated when the research was initially funded\u2014have been realized. In the United States, that will require a long-term commitment from the government, complementing the ongoing investment of risk capital and key industry sectors. America's leadership role in scientific innovation is an inherited responsibility and an economic imperative. It must not be neglected. \u21b5* www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/business-leaders-agree-u-s-funding-of-basic-research-advances-prosperity-security-well-being/ ", "abstract": "", "introduction": "", "discussion": ""}, "37": {"type": "Editorial", "title": "A short presidential reading list", "author": ["Jeremy Berg"], "authorInstitution": ["Editor-in-Chief, Science Journals"], "publisher": "American Association for the Advancement of Science", "date": "2016/10/21", "doi": "10.1126/science.aal2121", "pdfLink": "/content/354/6310/265.full.pdf", "textLink": "/content/354/6310/265.full.txt", "text": "A new U.S. president will be sworn into office in less than 3 months. Because scientific issues cut across many aspects of modern life, in both the public and private sectors, the president has several challenges. He or she must ensure that the government has access to robust advice about scientific issues to guide policy development. The president must select, and the U.S. Senate must confirm, the leaders for agencies with a substantial science focus. Finally, the new president must set the tone regarding the importance of science in the nation's progress. Two short, 70-year-old documents outline many central issues that are still relevant today. \u201c\u2026these\u2026documents\u2026lay out principles for the importance of science in society\u2026\u201d The advisory role of science in the administration is held by the president's science adviser (formally, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology Policy). President Franklin Roosevelt established a precursor to this position during World War II with the appointment of Vannevar Bush as head of the Office of Scientific Research and Development. Bush was an engineer who had been a cofounder of the American Appliance Company (which later became the Raytheon Company), a faculty member at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. He is perhaps best known as the author of two seminal documents. In 1945, Bush delivered \u201cScience, The Endless Frontier\u201d* as a report requested by President Roosevelt (likely at Bush's urging). This treatise detailed a compelling vision for the role of science in society, especially for basic science funded by the federal government. After an introduction, its subsequent chapters present many key elements of governmental science policy: \u201cThe War Against Disease\u201d emphasizes the importance of broad and basic studies, as well as coordinated attacks on specific diseases; \u201cScience and the Public Welfare\u201d describes the role of science for job creation and the importance of academic basic research to complement research in industry; \u201cRenewal of Our Scientific Talent\u201d highlights the importance of training and recruiting talent in a manner that includes men, women, and those with limited economic means; \u201cA Problem of Scientific Reconversion\u201d describes the challenges of scientists transitioning from wartime to peacetime research and the open publication of scholarly results; and \u201cThe Means to the End\u201d lists five principles for federal support of basic research with no expectation of immediate practical results, and concludes with a detailed outline for creating the National Research Agency. \u201cScience, The Endless Frontier\u201d presented a thoughtful outline for science in peacetime and, although many features of it were not implemented, its recommendations were reflected in the creation of the National Science Foundation in 1950. In 1945, Bush also published \u201cAs We May Think\u201d\u2020 in a popular magazine, The Atlantic Monthly. This strikingly prescient essay presents a crisp vision for the roles of machines in information storage and computation, and the need to convert large amounts of information into useful knowledge. Many features of his picture have come true\u2014mostly in the past decade. Bush presented his ideas to inspire the citizenry to think about science and technology as a path to improving their futures, both with respect to extant tasks and futuristic ones. As the president-elect considers many of the nation's challenges related to science, I have a simple suggestion: Read these two Vannevar Bush documents. They lay out principles for the importance of science in society, the interactions between academic and industrial science, the compelling nature of scientific discovery, and the importance of thinking with a long time horizon. This will provide a strong framework for selecting key leaders for the next administration and for being a good consumer of the information and advice that they provide. It will be an hour or two well spent. \u21b5* www.nsf.gov/about/history/vbush1945.htm \u21b5\u2020 www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/ ", "abstract": "", "introduction": "", "discussion": ""}, "38": {"type": "Editorial", "title": "Dealing with details in Marrakesh", "author": ["Patricia Espinosa"], "authorInstitution": ["Patricia Espinosa is the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change"], "publisher": "American Association for the Advancement of Science", "date": "2016/10/28", "doi": "10.1126/science.aal2558", "pdfLink": "/content/354/6311/393.full.pdf", "textLink": "/content/354/6311/393.full.txt", "text": "Over the next few weeks, two major events will take place\u2014the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change will enter into force on 4 November, and 3 days later, nearly 200 countries will convene in Marrakesh, Morocco, at the 22nd United Nations (UN) Conference of the Parties (COP22) to decide on how to rapidly implement the agreement. Indeed, the agreement's governing body will hold its first meeting during COP22. This swift action to commit and come up with climate action plans is a welcome departure for the international community, and it sends a clear message that success in tackling climate challenges requires more than just a historic political agreement. \u201cAchieving the aims of the Paris Agreement is not a given.\u201d The Paris Agreement was adopted in December 2015 at the COP21 meeting. For the first time, nations agreed on a single primary goal\u2014to limit global warming to well below a 2\u00b0C rise (and as close to 1.5\u00b0C as possible), thereby preventing dangerous tipping points in the climate system. This means that global carbon emissions must be driven down drastically and balanced against carbon removal during the second half of this century. Paris was a milestone, yet the Marrakesh Summit is equally important given that governments must now deal with the details. This includes negotiating the rule book to the Paris Agreement, which is, in effect, a global blueprint for reporting and accounting for climate action under the agreement. Another detail is the need for a roadmap on how to mobilize $100 billion in pledged annual support, through 2020. This is critical for financing climate adaptation, strengthening capacity building, and assisting developing countries in taking greater climate action. Marrakesh will offer opportunities to fortify partnerships that accelerate transitions toward a low\u2013carbon emissions future and promote the sustainable development goals that governments already have committed to meet. Importantly, Marrakesh will see initiatives for implementing Nationally Determined Contributions\u2014national climate plans\u2014and integrating them into each country's development agenda alongside the UN Sustainable Development Goals (also adopted in 2015). The brilliance of the Paris Agreement is its decentralized approach. Success rests on national climate plans that will be updated every 5 years, and updates must demonstrate progress beyond previous plans. Thus, each plan's execution requires continued political leadership and momentum, as well as reinforced public understanding of the enormous social, health, and economic benefits that will accrue to citizens everywhere from strong, continually escalating climate action. The national plans therefore need to trigger more climate-friendly, coordinated laws, policies, and incentives. Favoring old growth and development models based on fossil fuels and high-carbon lifestyles must be abandoned as quickly as possible. UN estimates show that achieving sustainable development worldwide will require $5 trillion to $7 trillion a year, a large slice of which must fund the essential transition to a low-carbon, resilient global economy. Governments and public- and private-sector institutions need to be willing to allocate tens of billions of dollars toward climate and sustainable investments. The shift is already under way in many nations, and money is also being allocated by multilateral development banks and by dedicated sources such as the UN Green Climate Fund. However, only the private sector has sufficient money, resources, and reach to support governments in the full implementation of national climate plans. The great breakthrough before and since COP21 is that businesses are increasingly convinced that their own profitable future is inextricably linked to low-carbon, sustainable development. Therefore, increasing the private sector's appetite to fund the transformation is essential. Achieving the aims of the Paris Agreement is not a given. This is a multidecadal effort to turn around two centuries of world development that has been based on fossil fuels. COP22 is a crucial step onto a sustainable course for everyone, everywhere. We are embarking on the right path\u2014let's accelerate action now.

Candidates for the position presented their vision of international health work and the role of this global health body. Having worked at WHO in a number of capacities in the area of infectious diseases, I know well that international health covers a wide breadth of issues. Add to that noncommunicable diseases and matters such as intellectual property and universal health coverage, and it becomes clear that the next director-general must be a jack of all trades, but also a master of one\u2014leadership in public health. Leadership in this role is about conceiving and articulating a vision, staying faithful to that vision in the face of undue influence, and effectively engaging with not only governments, but with all stakeholders to gain their support and enable the vision to be realized. \u201c\u2026leadership in public health\u2026is about conceiving and articulating a vision\u2026\u201d International health not only concerns the transborder spread of infectious diseases and epidemics, which have recently been high on the political and media agenda. It is much broader and includes many health challenges, ranging from antimicrobial resistance and hazards such as natural disasters, to war, nuclear accidents, and chemical spills. Noncommunicable disease risk factors such as poor nutrition, lack of physical exercise, and smoking also cross international borders\u2014physically, as with the spread of chemical spills or nuclear fallout, and through advertising and marketing. They are therefore an important part of international health, although they attract less media interest. These factors are often driven by sectors outside of health, unlike infectious diseases, which are mostly naturally occurring and depend on government reporting and action. This complicates the landscape of those who must come to the table when problems are discussed. In addition, public health decision-making by WHO must be safeguarded from undue influence. Thus, there are constraints on the director-general's interaction with nonstate actors. For example, on a day-to-day basis, the director-general must discuss international health problems with nongovernmental organizations and private companies that deal with pharmaceuticals, food, alcohol, and other goods. This adds even more complexity to the director-general's job, as the decisions made must be the right ones for public health. WHO's focus on improving preparedness for public health emergencies, especially for infectious diseases with epidemic potential, must also be maintained. For example, its Research and Development Blueprint was initiated last year toward the end of the West Africa Ebola crisis. This year, proposals on technologies emerged, ranging from vaccines and immunotherapy to diagnostics. The next director-general must not only continue to encourage innovative thinking in preparedness, but must also draw the public and private sectors together to develop these global public goods and ensure equitable access for all who need them. And finally, the WHO regional structure must be supported through constant interaction with the director-general. Each regional office has a director who is nominated by the WHO member states of the region\u2014the same states that collectively decide on who will be director-general at the global level. It has often been said by senior staff at WHO that much more effort must be made to ensure that country, regional, and headquarters staffs work in harmony, compared to the effort spent on technical activities that support country needs. On 1 July 2017, a new WHO director-general will take office. In the final decision-making steps, it will be important to identify the candidate who will be a technically sound leader with a deep understanding of politics and an ability to channel all stakeholders to the right outcome. This job takes boldness in vision, and the skills to bring others along with that vision.

The bruising 2016 presidential campaign revealed societal fragmentation across the nation. Being in Berlin to absorb the election news had some unique resonances. Here, history has shown that there can be grave dangers in division and benefits of unification. Yet countries everywhere are showing signs of deep polarization. We must understand more fully these divisions. Communities at all levels and across sectors must work hard on drawing citizenry, and the world, together. The scientific community must recognize its important role in helping to break down barriers and find solutions that will build better lives for everyone. \u201cMoving ahead productively will be an important test\u2026for everyone.\u201d Falling Walls is where scientists from around the world have convened for the past 8 years to discuss how to tackle society's major challenges. The name of the conference is derived from the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989, which reunified East and West Germany. Germany, Europe, and the world have benefitted greatly from the reunification. Ironically, this date also corresponds to the anniversary of Kristallnacht, the Night of the Broken Glass, when, in 1938, Nazi soldiers and civilians rampaged across Germany, destroying Jewish businesses and synagogues. This fragmentation of society foreshadowed horrors yet to come. These events are not meant to imply a comparison of leaders, but rather, to provide clear markers of the power of unity and the dangers of division. Deep discontent and substantial differences in opinion now exist across America. Much of this discord is centered around the impact of globalization. Voting patterns changed in regions where, for example, there were once traditional centers of heavy industry and domestic manufacturing jobs. The election results and exit polling also revealed that the United States is sharply divided along lines of gender, race, and educational attainment. And yet, historically, Americans have always shared many important characteristics, including a strong work ethic; a willingness to take risks; an acceptance, if at times quite grudging, of welcoming immigrants to build better lives for themselves and for all of us; and an ability to invent and discover, with tremendous societal and economic benefits. Many of the discussions that I had in Berlin have shown how these features are highly regarded and respected by other countries. These qualities may unravel if the nation's societal distress is not carefully examined. The scientific enterprise embodies many of these cherished characteristics, and its own history and culture of problem-solving and collaboration may help bridge the divides. Research requires hours of hard work, often frustrating and seemingly fruitless. Exploring new areas or translating results into practical benefits requires expenditure of time and effort and, sometimes, considerable financial risk. This enterprise has been global for a long time, and the United States gains tremendously from individuals who begin or extend their scientific careers in this country. Many \u201cAmerican\u201d Nobel laureates came to the United States from abroad. What is the output? Technological innovation and unimagined discoveries that drive progress, open new opportunities, and improve societal well-being. It is important to understand the basis for the divisions across the United States and elsewhere. The tools of social science should be harnessed to better examine these divides. This will require careful listening to avoid missing important cues. While such a diagnostic phase is under way, scientists must continue to reach out and offer insights and mechanisms that provide the factual foundations for a collective path forward. The United States now ventures into somewhat uncharted territory with a president-elect who will come into office with no experience in governing and relatively vague positions about many aspects of domestic and foreign policy.

The next U.S. Administration and the Congress should revisit the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in view of current realities and work together toward enhanced security through ratification and an international push for entry into force. \u201cThe time has come to revisit CTBT ratification.\u201d Nuclear weapons have been central to strategic stability among nations and alliances for more than half a century. Even as American and international leaders aspire to and work toward a stable world verifiably free of nuclear weapons, this outcome cannot be expected for a considerable time. Voluntary suspension of nuclear testing by the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council for over two decades has made an enormous contribution to stability and nuclear nonproliferation. India and Pakistan ceased testing nearly as long ago, adding a degree of stability in a challenging security environment. The international agreement that verifiably eliminates the risk of an Iranian nuclear weapon greatly mitigates the risk of a proliferation sprint in the Middle East. The glaring exception is North Korea with its nuclear testing as recently as September, demonstrating vividly the regional and global destabilizing effect of nuclear tests. All of this argues for a binding no-test regime. In 1999, the Senate evaluated the CTBT, but did not consent to its ratification. Two principal objections needed to be addressed. The newly created science-based stockpile stewardship program, designed to replace nuclear test explosions with an integrated scientific program of computer simulations, data analysis, and laboratory tests of weapons subsystems, was at least a decade away from having its suite of new tools in place. There was also uncertainty about the ability to detect low-yield clandestine underground tests anywhere in the world. At that time, I argued within the Clinton Administration for a time-limited CTBT approval, providing a period during which the needed science and technology could be developed and deployed. Although the approval didn't happen, the science and technology did mature. The time has come to revisit CTBT ratification. The stockpile stewardship innovation that took place in the Department of Energy's (DOE) national laboratories since the end of testing in 1992 is remarkable. Nothing was off the shelf, including a new supercomputing architecture and experimental facilities that explore previously unattainable pressures and temperatures. These capabilities have led to a continuously increasing understanding of nuclear weapons properties and dynamics that could not be approached within the testing paradigm. Each year, the Secretaries of Defense and of Energy provide the president with an assessment of the deterrent, building on a peer review carried out by the DOE national security laboratory directors and the commander of the Department of Defense's Strategic Command. All indications are that the stockpile will remain safe, secure, and reliable indefinitely without testing, even as the weapons age and are reduced in number. The new toolkits of supercomputer systems and lab facilities are unlocking additional benefits, such as simulating fluid dynamics for better engines and turbines, handling enormous data sets for cancer research and treatment, and probing energetic astrophysical phenomena. The global monitoring network necessary for worldwide detection of nuclear explosions has been built. Incredibly sensitive measurements can now detect and identify radionuclide signatures associated with nuclear explosive tests, including low-yield or evasive tests. With the treaty in force, international experts will conduct an on-site inspection after a suspect event. In short, the United States and its partners have the technology needed to make the CTBT work for deterrence and strategic stability. Clearly, ratification by the Senate will not itself bring the treaty into force, but it will provide a stronger foundation for achieving a global testing ban and for amplifying international pressure and sanctions on any country that does test.

Could the world ever have imagined a number exceeding that produced by the Nazis and World War II? The conflict over Syria alone, raging since 2011, has so far resulted in more than 11 million refugees and internally displaced persons. Over the past year, international summits have convened to address this global crisis, including the United Nations Summit in September. There is a growing view that the world must recognize these individuals not as part of a temporary emergency, but as a long-term challenge, and one where higher education can play a major role. \u201cDisplaced scholars\u2026need the support of\u2026the international academic community\u2026\u201d The immediate challenges of refugee management can, understandably, overshadow taking stock of the vast scope of people who are displaced. Among those who have had their education, or their career in academia, interrupted are the many scholars and scientists whose lives and work serve thousands more. If you consider the decades of study and training, the ripple effect of published work, and the numbers of students taught, each scholar represents the compounded potential to deliver lifesaving innovations and ground-breaking scientific discovery that could reach countless others. Many of these scholars will have no safe home to return to in the foreseeable future. During and after World War II, efforts were made to help scholars who were dismissed from German universities on racial and political grounds. Initiatives such as the Academic Assistance Council [now known as the Council for At-Risk Academics (CARA)] and the Emergency Committee for Displaced German and European Scholars of the Institute of International Education (IIE) helped scholars who were forced out of Germany. Today, organizations including CARA, IIE, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation's Philipp Schwartz Initiative, and the Scholars at Risk network continue to build lifelines for academics at risk. For example, the IIE Scholar Rescue Fund has provided fellowships to nearly 700 professors and senior researchers from 56 countries, including Syria and other war-torn countries such as Iraq and Yemen\u2014nearly twice as many academics as the organization helped during World War II. These rescued scholars have joined universities, teaching hospitals, research institutions, and laboratories around the world that have not only accepted them as their own, but have gained in return. One scholar, who was forced out of Belarus, now leads research in nanotechnology in the United States where he continues to pioneer diagnostic techniques for chronic diseases. Another refugee scholar from Nigeria, well known in the field of immunology, continued her research on infectious diseases in South Africa and Kenya before returning home to an improved security situation. Recognizing such outcomes, students at Rockefeller University in New York, along with postdoc-led organizations such as INet NYC, have committed to help displaced scientists adapt to a new academic culture and a long-term career path in the United States. Displaced scholars, whether refugees or in exile, need the support of institutions large and small, in countries large and small, to break through the barriers that prevent them from academic engagement and employment\u2014fears that they will take jobs away, require more help than they give, or not make the transition to teaching students in the host country. In succumbing to this backlash, we forget that the world's great universities became great because they welcomed refugees, exiles, and thinkers in distress. With support from the international academic community, threatened scholars and scientists can be saved. Let us all ensure that academic training is not wasted, knowledge for present and future generations is preserved, and that the next Albert Einstein or Felix Bloch is not lost in the painful currents of forced emigration.

The word \u201crightful\u201d is usually taken to mean legitimate or morally appropriate. Yet, the word \u201cright\u201d has multiple meanings; it can mean morally good or justified, as noted above, but it can also mean true or correct as fact. It is the latter meaning that is essential for the position of science in government. \u201c\u2026let respect for data and rigorous analysis establish the rightful place for science\u2026\u201d The scientific method has proved to be the best method for determining what is factually correct. Facts are important because they are robust and provide foundations on which intellectual constructs and technologies can be built. Consider, for example, investigations by Albert Michelson and Edward Morley on the speed of light. To their surprise, they discovered, with great precision, that the speed of light was the same in all directions. This became a pillar for Hendrik Lorentz's and Albert Einstein's work leading to formulation of the theory of special relativity. Today, it provides the framework for a vast amount of modern technology, such as Global Positioning Systems. The ability for science to get the facts right also has profound implications for health care. While I was a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine during the 1990s, the AIDS epidemic continued to accelerate in the absence of effective treatments. There were serious discussions of how to manage the crisis as hospital beds filled with AIDS patients, with projections that the capacity to handle the situation would soon be overwhelmed. The identification of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as the cause of AIDS, the demonstration that two enzyme activities (reverse transcriptase and protease) were essential for the viability of the virus, and the development of combination therapies that included inhibitors of both enzymes stopped acceleration of the epidemic in developed countries. Remarkably, it was recently reported that individuals in the United States infected with HIV are now more likely to die from smoking-related diseases than from AIDS. The adverse health effects of tobacco, of course, had previously been established by scientific investigations, but those results were met with denial of the facts and considerable political resistance, delaying policy changes and societal benefits. American surgeon Bernard Fisher nicely framed the importance of the scientific method for getting the facts on which policies and practices can be based. In the 1960s, Fisher questioned the notion of radical, deforming operations as the best way to treat breast cancer. On the basis of laboratory results, he believed that breast cancer could be a systemic rather than a local disease. From this basic science insight, Fisher proposed that some breast cancer surgeries failed to prevent metastasis because the cancer had already spread at the time of surgery. He led a clinical trial comparing radical mastectomy with more limited surgery in the face of considerable opposition, including accusations of unethically risking patients' lives. The trial found no significant difference in the results of the two approaches. Fisher described his approach to mediating scientific discussions with the statement, \u201cIn God we trust; all others require data.\u201d The United States will face many issues related to climate change, medical and public health challenges including vaccines and other technologies, and the roles of computers and artificial intelligence tools in society, among other national and global matters. In 2017, let respect for data and rigorous analysis establish the rightful place for science in the new U.S. administration. \u21b5* www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/06/21/100-examples-putting-science-its-rightful-place ", "abstract": "", "introduction": "", "discussion": ""}}}
