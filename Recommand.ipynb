       "'The MaxDiscovery Toxicity Assay Kits monitor in vivo toxicity by measuring liver and heart function in serum samples. These simple and convenient tests allow the rapid, colorimetirc determination of well-characterized functional markers of liver and heart toxicity. They can be used to monitor toxic effects caused by administration of small-interfering RNA, DNA plasmids, transfection agents, or other therapeutic treatments during preclinical studies. The assays can be used in a range of mammals, including mice and rats, providing a powerful tool to assess and reduce the toxicity of drug formulations and to improve drug delivery methods.  Bioo Scientific  For info: 512-707-8993 www.biooscientific.com The Protein Fractionation Kit enables the stepwise separation and preparation of cytoplasmic, membrane, nuclear soluble, chromatin-bound, and cytoskeletal protein extracts from mammalian cultured cells or tissue for protein localization studies or enrichment of specific cellular compartments. The simple protocol is completed in less than three hours and requires no ultracentrifugation over gradients during any of the steps. The subcellular extracts obtained are compatible with a variety of downstream applications, including protein assays, protein immunoblotting, electrophoretic mobility assays, and enzyme activity assays. The kit includes four extraction buffers, a stabilized nuclease, and the Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail.

The service provides drug developers with cell-based assays to evaluate the functional selectivity of drugs against GPCRs. Although 40 percent of all marketed drugs are targeted to GPCRs, the similarity of GPCR binding sites coupled with saturated intellectual property around this chemical space have hampered GPCR drug discovery efforts. Increasingly, drug makers are instead focusing on novel allosteric GPCR sites to open up new chemical spaces, and this service is designed to help in that effort. The service allows researchers to screen the selectivity of their allosteric compounds for more than 150 GPCRs.
